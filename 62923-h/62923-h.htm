<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>During the thirty years which have elapsed since Dr. Auer’s
application of the rare earths to the production of artificial
light, the incandescent mantle industry has developed to an
extent which gives it a prominent place among those chemical
industries which may be considered essential to modern civilisation.
This technical development has in turn assisted and
stimulated the scientific examination of the elements of this
group, with the result that ordered and accurate knowledge
is beginning to replace the confused and uncertain data
which had been collected by earlier workers in the field. These
advances have served to emphasise the scientific interest and
importance of the rare earth group, and the difficulty of bringing
it into relation with the other elements. The relatively scant
attention devoted to the study of this province of inorganic
chemistry by teachers and students in England is probably
due no less to the difficulty in classification, and the uncertainty
with regard to the homogeneity and individuality of the various
members of the family&mdash;an uncertainty by no means entirely
removed even now&mdash;than to the fact that the very extensive
literature on the subject is somewhat confused and difficult
of access, especially to those unfamiliar with the French and
German languages.</p>

<p>The present work is intended to give a general but fairly
comprehensive account of the rare earth group. In accordance
with general usage, the elements zirconium and thorium have
been included, though these are now recognised as falling outside
the limits of the rare earth group proper. The inclusion of
titanium, which chemically is so far removed from the cerium
and yttrium elements, has been considered desirable, not only
on account of its general occurrence in the rare earth minerals,
and its position in Group IV<span class="smcapall">B</span> with zirconium, cerium, and
thorium, but also on account of its increasing chemical and<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
technical interest, and its use in the ordinary quantitative
laboratory operations.</p>

<p>Though the nature of the matter embraced has rendered
the division into three parts desirable, the whole subject has
been treated primarily from the chemical standpoint. In
view, however, of the occurrence of considerable quantities
of monazite within the British Empire, and of the possibility
that in the near future the Brazilian fields will not remain
the sole source of thorium nitrate, stress has been laid on the
technical aspect, which is more especially developed as regards
the production of monazite and the incandescent mantle
industry in Chapters VII and XVII-XX.</p>

<p>In the preparation of Part I full use has been made of
Dana’s indispensable ‘System of Mineralogy,’ as well as of the
encyclopædic ‘Handbuch’ of Hintze, whilst for Part II the
excellent monograph of R. J. Meyer, in Abegg’s ‘Handbuch,’
Vol. III, Div. I, and the work of the same author and
Hauser, ‘Die Analyse der seltenen Erden und der Erdsäuren,’
Vols. XIV-XV of ‘Die Chemische Analyse,’ have been of
service.</p>

<h2><span class="topline">INTRODUCTION</span><br />
By <span class="smcap">Sir William Crookes</span>, O.M., F.E.S.</h2>

<p>The mysterious group of substances to which have been
given the title of “rare earths” has long been the subject of
my special study, and no one knows better the magnitude
of the difficulties encountered in the investigation, or realises
more clearly the comparative insignificance of the knowledge
we have acquired. The rare earths constitute the most
striking example of the association of chemical substances
with others which are closely allied to themselves, and from
which they are separable only with extreme difficulty. They
form a group to themselves, sharply demarcated from the
other elements, and it is my belief that by following the study
of them to the utmost limits, we may arrive at the explanation
of what the chemical elements really are and how they
originated, and discover the reasons for their properties and
mutual relations. When this knowledge has been wrested
from Nature chemistry will be established upon an entirely
new basis. We shall be set free from the need for experiment,
knowing <i>a priori</i> what the result of each and every
experiment must be; and our knowledge then will as much
transcend our present scientific systems as the knowledge
of the skilled mathematician of the present day exceeds
that of primitive man, counting upon his fingers. The
great problem of the nature and genesis of the elements is
approaching solution, and when the consummation is reached
it will undoubtedly be found that the study of the rare earths
has been an important factor in bringing it about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagexiv">[xiv]</span></p>

<p>There has long been a need for a work in the English language
dealing historically and descriptively with these substances,
and Mr. Levy’s book is well fitted to fill the gap.
The chapters on the technical applications of the rare earths
are particularly valuable, and the chemical aspect of the
incandescent lighting industry is admirably treated. The
author is to be congratulated upon having successfully achieved
an important and useful piece of work.</p>

OCCURRENCE OF THE RARE EARTHS</h2>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER I</span><br />
THE NATURE OF THE MINERALS AND THEIR MODE
OF OCCURRENCE</h3>

<p>The history of the rare earth minerals begins in the year 1751,
when the Swedish mineralogist Cronstedt described a new
mineral, which he had found intimately mixed with chalcopyrite<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
in the quarry of Bastnäs, near Ryddarhyttan, in the
province of Westmannland, Sweden. Cronstedt gave the
mineral the name Tung-sten (heavy stone); but as the name
Tenn-spat (heavy spar, or heavy mineral) had already been
selected by Wallerius (1747) for a new species from Bohemia,
believed to contain tin, the choice was not a happy one. More
than fifty years after its discovery, a new earth, now known
as ceria, was isolated from Cronstedt’s mineral, for which at
the same time the name Cerite was proposed.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Meanwhile,
however, the Finnish chemist Johann Gadolin had observed,
in the year 1794, a new earth in a mineral discovered by
Arrhenius at Ytterby in Sweden in 1788; he called the new
oxide Ytterbia, and the mineral in which he observed it,
Ytterbite. The discovery was confirmed in 1797 by Ekeberg,
who suggested the names Yttria and Gadolinite for the oxide<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
and mineral respectively; these names were accepted by
Klaproth, and soon came into general use.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Whilst then
Cerite was the first of the rare earth minerals to be discovered,
it was in Gadolinite that new elements were first recognised,
and the chemistry of the rare earths began in 1794 with
Gadolin’s observation.</p>

The history of these names will be found somewhat more fully under

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>During the nineteenth century a considerable number of rare
earth minerals was discovered and analysed; the quantities
of the minerals observed, however, were so small that the
name ‘Rare earths,’ applied to the new oxides found, was in
every sense justified. Until the year 1885, though by that
time the scientific interest of the group had been fully demonstrated
by the discovery of several new elements, it was
supposed that the minerals were almost entirely confined to
a few scattered localities in Scandinavia and the Ural mountains.
In that year Dr. Auer von Welsbach announced his application
of the rare earths to the manufacture of incandescent mantles.
Immediately there was a great demand for raw material for
the preparation of thoria and ceria. The agents of the
Welsbach Company visited all the important mining centres
of Europe and America, intent on a search which shortly
made it clear that the metals of the so-called ‘rare earths’
are really quite widely distributed in nature. The chief
commercial deposits are the monazite sands of the Carolinas,
the Idaho basin, and Brazil, the gem-gravels of Ceylon, and
the remarkable deposits of gadolinite and allied minerals at
Barringer Hill in Texas.</p>

<p>Whilst deposits of commercial importance are not very
common, improved scientific methods and more careful search
have shown that in traces the rare earths are of exceedingly
wide distribution. Sir William Crookes has shown that yttria
earths are often present in calcite and in coral; whilst Headden<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
noted that quite considerable amounts (up to 0·03 per cent.)
were present in a yellow phosphorescent variety of calcite
from Colorado. Similarly Humphreys<a id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> found that fluorspar
usually contains traces of yttrium, whilst one or two phosphorescent<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
varieties contain quantities varying up to 0·05
per cent. The presence of yttria elements in phosphorescent
varieties of calcite is interesting, and some connection has
been suggested; there is, however, no positive ground for
the belief in such a relation.</p>

<p>More recently Eberhard<a id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has found very considerable
quantities of rare earths in cassiterite (tin dioxide, SnO₂) and
wolframite [an iron manganese tungstate, (Fe,Mn)WO₄].
A specimen of wolframite from the Erzgebirge was found to
contain nearly 0·4 per cent. of rare earths, over half of this
quantity being scandium oxide. A process which is readily
susceptible of commercial application has been worked out by
R. J. Meyer,<a id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for the extraction of scandia and the yttria
earths from the mixed oxides left after the treatment of
wolframite for tungstic acid.</p>

<p>Using the spectroscopic method, which is capable of detecting
one part of scandia in twenty thousand, Eberhard
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) has found that minute quantities of scandia and
yttria earths are present in almost all the commoner rocks
and minerals. The minerals richest in scandium were beryl,
cassiterite, wolfram, the zircon minerals, and the titanates
and columbates of the ceria and yttria oxides. These results
are in agreement with the observations of Sir William
Crookes,<a id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who has made the study of scandium especially
his own. From the fact that scandium was often observed
unaccompanied by any other member of the rare earth group,
Eberhard rather favours Urbain’s conclusion<a id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that scandium
may not be a member of the rare earth family. Spectroscopic
examination has also shown the existence of some of the rare
earth elements in the sun and stars (see Europium, <a href="#Page189">p. 189</a>).</p>

<p>In view of this extraordinarily wide distribution of the
rare earths in the mineral world, it is but natural that they
should be found also in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
Tschernik<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> found 10 per cent. of rare earths in the ash of a
coal from Kutais, in the Caucasus, and smaller quantities<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
have been found in the ashes of various plants; members
of the group have also been identified in the human body.</p>

<p>Apart from the general occurrence in traces throughout
the mineral kingdom, the minerals in which the rare earths
occur are not very common; and though of fairly wide
distribution, they are found usually only in small quantities.
The earliest known locality, and the most fruitful in regard
to number of species, has been the southern part of the Scandinavian
peninsula;<a id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the minerals occur in the numerous
pegmatite veins traversing the granitic country-rock. The
mining district round Miask, in the Ural mountains, has also
long been known as a fruitful source. Other districts in
Europe are the Harz and Erzgebirge, the Laacher See in
Prussia, Joachimsthal in Bohemia, Dauphiné, Cornwall, etc.
In the United States numerous localities are known; the chief
are in the Carolinas and Georgia, Idaho, Oregon, California,
Texas, Colorado, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
Many of the southern provinces of Brazil also furnish important
sources; the famous diamond fields of Minas Geraes, Matto-Grosso,
Goyaz and the surrounding provinces yield numerous
species, whilst the sands along the southern coasts of Bahia
are rich in monazite, and form to-day the most important
source of the mineral. Monazite, as well as other rare earth
minerals, occurs also in South Africa. An interesting species,
<a href="#Ref4">plumboniobite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), has recently been found in German East
Africa. From Australia numerous occurrences are reported,
whilst in Canada only a few districts are known to yield
members of the group. In Asia important localities are
Ceylon&mdash;the famous gem-gravels being the most accessible
source&mdash;and one or two districts in Japan; monazite has
been reported recently in considerable quantities near Travancore,
India.<a id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> A more extended search will doubtless show
that they occur in many other places.</p>

<p>For several reasons, the rare earth minerals<a id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> form a
group<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
of the highest scientific interest. In the first place, they are
generally of very complex composition, more especially with
regard to their rare earth content. Thus, whilst it sometimes
happens that one or other of the two groups of oxides (the
ceria and yttria groups) may predominate to the complete
exclusion of the second, it is no uncommon thing for a species
to contain almost all the elements of the rare earth family.
On the other hand, it is very uncommon for as much as 50 per
cent. of the rare earth content to consist of any one oxide.
The usual case is that a mineral contains chiefly yttria earths
with some ceria earths, or <i>vice versâ</i>, the two sub-groups being
almost always complex mixtures of several oxides, in which
occasionally one may predominate. The remarkable similarity
in chemical behaviour of the rare earth elements, and the
difficulty of separating them, correspond to this peculiarity in
their occurrence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote13"><a href="#FNanchor13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The phrase ‘rare earth minerals’ will be used
whenever it is desired to
indicate collectively those minerals of which the yttria and ceria earths form
an important constituent, as contrasted to those in which only traces of these
oxides occur. Such minerals may often contain titanium, zirconium, or
thorium, and, for convenience, the term may be taken to include the commoner
zirconium and thorium minerals, but not the commoner titanium minerals.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A second point of even greater interest is that the rare
earth minerals are as a general rule strongly radio-active;
further, it only occasionally happens that any mineral in
which the rare earths do not form an important constituent
has more than the feeblest activity; the exceptions being, of
course, those uranium minerals which do not contain rare
earths. The connection may be pushed even further; for
whilst it appears that hardly any rock or mineral possesses
absolutely no radio-activity, it is equally worthy of notice
that traces of the rare earths, if not quite universal in the
mineral world, are yet normally found in the majority of
common minerals. As a natural consequence of their activity,
the rare earth minerals are also as a rule rich in helium. These
facts and the problems which they open up will be treated
more fully in a later chapter.</p>

<p>A point of further interest is that of the age of the rare
earth minerals. Except in a few cases where they are obviously
of secondary formation, these minerals are among the oldest<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
known to us. They occur usually in igneous rocks, particularly
in granites which have been considerably metamorphosed.
Where erosion has occurred, they are found in deposits of
such a nature as to leave very little doubt that the original
rock was of plutonic formation and of very considerable age.
Whilst it is true, however, that the rare earth minerals are
generally of very great antiquity (none of the primary minerals
being of more recent date than the palæozoic age), Eberhard
has pointed out that the age and nature of common rocks
seem to have absolutely no influence on the traces of scandia
and yttria oxides which they contain. The geological evidence
shows that the rare earth minerals are on the whole
exceedingly stable, and that they have been generally formed
during the pegmatitic alteration of granites. As early as the
year 1840, Scheerer drew attention to these facts, and to
the extreme age of the rare earth minerals; but so far his
observation seems to have attracted little attention, and no
explanation has been put forward.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">In the following chapters no attempt is made to treat the
rare earth minerals fully. An alphabetical list of all the
minerals of any importance which contain rare earths, titanium,
zirconium or thorium is given, and of these several are selected
for fuller treatment. The basis of selection has been somewhat
arbitrary. Those species which are of mineralogical
importance, as well as those to which any special historical,
scientific or commercial interest attaches, have of course been
singled out; in addition, the more recently discovered species
have occasionally been considered worthy of separate mention.<a id="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

A full list of the minerals containing rare earths known up to 1904, with
an account of their properties and very full references, will be found in the work
of Dr. J. Schilling, <i>Das Vorkommen der Seltenen Erden im Mineralreiche</i>, 1904.</p>

<p>It is now being realised that some knowledge of crystallography
is essential to the chemist, and for this reason short
accounts of the crystallography of the selected types have
been given. Apart from this, every effort has been made to
render the mineralogy intelligible to the student of chemistry
who has devoted no attention previously to this subject, and
also to stimulate an interest in the problems of mineral<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
chemistry, unfortunately too often ignored by our present-day
teachers. The rare earth minerals afford good examples of
some phenomena of great interest to the chemist, as, <i>e.g.</i>
Isomorphism and Solid Solution, Dimorphism, Isodimorphism,
and Molecular Change, and in one or two cases these are
treated rather fully.</p>

<p>No special advantages are claimed for the system of
classification, which is merely one of convenience. The
minerals are divided into five <span class="nowrap">groups:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind05">(1) The Silicates, which are grouped into three sub-divisions.</p>

<p class="hind05">(2) The Titano-silicates and the Titanates.</p>

<p class="hind05">(3) The Tantalo-columbates, sub-divided into those free
from titanium and those in which titanium is present.</p>

<p class="hind05">(4) The Oxides and Carbonates.</p>

<p class="hind05">(5) The Halides and Phosphates.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Cerite.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Cerite is a silicate of the cerium metals, with
small amounts of lime, ferrous oxide and water. Hintze gives
the formula H₃(Ca,Fe)Ce₃Si₃O₁₃,<a id="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which Groth interprets as
a basic metasilicate (Ca,Fe)[CeO]Ce₂(OH)₃(SiO₃)₃, <i>i.e.</i> a basic
salt of the acid H₆Si₃O₉, a polymer of metasilicic acid, H₂SiO₃.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote15"><a href="#FNanchor15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
The symbol (Ca,Fe) here indicates that the iron and calcium occur in
variable proportions, the variation however occurring in such a way that the
equivalent of the two taken together is always the same, <i>i.e.</i> the iron can
replace the calcium, or <i>vice versa</i>, atom by atom. The recognition of this
possibility of ‘Vicarious Replacement’ between similar elements first brought
order into the confused field of mineral chemistry, and allowed a systematic
classification of minerals according to chemical composition to be made. Iron
and calcium, or, according to the more convenient nomenclature of the mineralogists,
lime and ferrous oxide, are here vicarious constituents.</p>

<p>The symbol Ce here stands for elements of the cerium group, which are
never found singly.</p>

<p>Cerite is infusible before the blowpipe. It is attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
readily by sulphuric acid, less easily by hydrochloric acid, with
which it gives a gelatinous mass. Rammelsberg<a id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> found that
the silica left behind on treatment of the powdered granular
variety with the latter acid contained a variable proportion
of bases, which he obtained and estimated after fusing the
siliceous residue with sodium carbonate. From the different
proportions of the earths in the part attacked by the acid and
that left in the silica, he remarks, ‘It would almost appear
that Cerite is a mixture of silicates which are not all attacked
with the same ease by hydrochloric acid.’ Apparently without
previous knowledge of this observation, Welsbach<a id="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> noticed
the same thing in 1884. He concluded that ordinary granular
‘cerite’ is a mixture of several minerals, among which there
are at least two which contain rare earths. Of these, one, the
chief constituent of the aggregate, is probably identical with
the crystallised mineral, and is characterised by the readiness
and completeness with which it is attacked by hydrochloric
acid. The other does not react, with hydrochloric, but is
readily attacked by sulphuric acid; it contains yttria earths,
in addition to the ceria earths. In the extraction of ceria
earths from the mineral aggregate, Welsbach used hydrochloric
acid, so leaving this second mineral unchanged; but to avoid
loss of the rare earths, sulphuric acid is more commonly
employed for the decomposition.</p>

<p id="Ref1">Though of great historical interest, cerite is of very small
importance for the extraction of rare earths at the present
time, on account of its very rare occurrence. The mineral
seems to be almost entirely confined to the Bastnäs quarry
near Ryddarhyttan, Sweden, where it is found with the rare
earth silicate <a href="#Ref33">allanite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), biotite, hornblende, bismuth
glance, chalcopyrite, etc. Here it was observed in 1751 by
Cronstedt, who called it Tungsten (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page1">p. 1</a>). In
1781 Scheele examined a specimen of Wallerius’s ‘Tenn-spat’
from Bipsberg, Dalecarlia, and found Tungstic Oxide (Acid),
WO₃, in it.<a id="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
After Scheele’s work, the Ryddarhyttan mineral<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
was known as Red Tungsten, until Bergmann (1780) and
d’Elhuyar (1784) showed that the two minerals were chemically
distinct. They considered the red variety to be a silicate of
iron and calcium, the rare earths being mistaken for lime.
In 1804 Klaproth examined it, and found a new earth; he
called the mineral ‘Ochroite,’ from its colour. In the same
year, but independently of Klaproth, Berzelius and Hisinger
made the same discovery; they called the mineral Cerite and
the new metal Cerium, in honour of the discovery of the minor
planet Ceres by Piazzi in 1801.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote18"><a href="#FNanchor18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
This mineral, which Scheele knew as Tungstein, is now called Scheelite.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The analyses of cerite made in the earlier part of the nineteenth
century resulted in some confusion. Klaproth in 1807
found 34·5 per cent. SiO₂ in a specimen (his Ochroite);
Vauquelin in 1805, and Hisinger in 1810, found 17·0 and 18·0
per cent. respectively.<a id="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Hermann<a id="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> called attention to this
discrepancy in 1843 (and again in 1861), and declared that
the two could not be the same. For Klaproth’s mineral he
proposed to revive the name Ochroite, whilst from his own
analyses he proposed for the cerite of Berzelius the name
Lanthanocerite, having found carbon dioxide and lanthanum,
with much less cerium, in the latter.<a id="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In 1861 Kenngott
partly explained these results by showing that the sample of
cerite which Hermann had analysed contained Lanthanite<a id="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>;
but the extraordinarily high percentage of silica obtained by
Klaproth remained unexplained. It may have been due to
impurities of high silica content in the specimen he examined.</p>

<a href="#Ref35">Lanthanite</a> (see <a href="#Ref34">list</a>) is an hydrated carbonate, R₂O₃,3CO₂,9H₂O, where
R = cerium metals, chiefly Lanthanum.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Cerite contains from 59·4 to 71·8 per cent. of rare earths
(oxides), the amount and nature of which vary with the precise
locality. The oxides consist chiefly of ceria, lanthana, and
didymia (praseodymia and neodymia), the complexity of the
so-called ceria having been shown by Mosander in the case of
ceria separated from gadolinite as well as from cerite; but
yttria earths are also found to a small extent in the mineral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span></p>

<p>It is remarkable that neither thorium nor uranium has
been found in cerite, which is thus practically unique among
the rare earth minerals.</p>

<p>This anomaly becomes even more marked in view of the
very high percentage of inert gases found by Tschernik<a id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in
a related mineral from Batoum. This is a very complex
mineral in which the basic part is represented by rare earths,
chiefly ceria earths (50·8 per cent.) with water (3·4 per cent.),
and oxides of iron, calcium and copper (6·8 per cent.); the
acidic oxides being silica (6·6 per cent.), zirconia (11·6 per
cent.), and titanium dioxide (14·7 per cent.), with phosphorus
pentoxide (3·2 per cent.), and sulphuric anhydride (1·7 per
cent.). Traces of thoria are present, but no uranium; very considerable
quantities (up to 1 per cent.?) of helium were found.</p>

resembles it closely.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Ref42"><b>Gadolinite</b> (Ytterbite).</h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Gadolinite is a silicate of
iron, beryllium, and the yttria earths, of the formula
2BeO,FeO,Y₂O₃,2SiO₂, which may be written FeBe₂Y₂Si₂O₁₀.
According to Groth, it is a basic orthosilicate, Be₂Fe(YO)₂(SiO₄)₂,
derived from the acid H₈Si₂O₈. The beryllium content varies
considerably, and some authors recognise two varieties of
the mineral, one rich, and one poor in beryllium; but Scheerer
pointed out in 1840 that iron and beryllium are probably
vicarious constituents.</p>

<p>Analysis gives silica 21·8 to 25·3 per cent.; yttria earths
22 to 47 per cent.; ceria earths 5 to 31 per cent. In a variety
from Ytterby, the rare earth Scandia was first found, forming
up to 0·02 per cent. of the mineral. Small quantities of
thoria, ThO₂ may be present, and traces of helium were found
by Ramsay, Collie, and Travers. According to Strutt it contains
also uranium and radium. Like cerite, it does not often
occur crystalline, being usually found in amorphous masses.</p>

<div class="details">

<p id="Ref43">Gadolinite is of common occurrence in the pegmatite
veins of the Scandinavian granite. It was first found in a
felspar quarry on the island of Ytterby, near Stockholm, by
a Lieutenant Arrhenius<a id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; it is also found, together with a
large number of other rare earth minerals, at Fahlun. It occurs
in Norway on the islands of Hitterö and Malö, and in Germany
in the Riesengebirge and the Harz. Probably the largest
deposit is that in Texas, at Barringer Hill, near Bluffton, on
the west bank of the Colorado River, Llano County, now owned
and worked by the Nernst Light Company of Pittsburg; in 1904
a mass of very pure gadolinite weighing 200 lb. was found here.<a id="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In the same place a decomposition product of gadolinite
was discovered by Hidden and Mackintosh in 1889. They
named it Yttrialite or Green Gadolinite. It contains no
beryllium, and twice as much silica as the parent mineral,
and approximates to the formula R₂O₃,2SiO₂, where R₂O₃ is
chiefly yttria oxides; it is thus similar in composition to the
newly found scandium silicate, <a href="#Ref36">Thortveitite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). It is amorphous
and massive; and is often found in continuous growth with
gadolinite. Pieces up to 10 lb. in weight have been obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span></p>

<p id="Ref2">As stated above, Gadolinite was discovered by Arrhenius
in 1788. Geijer examined it in the same year, and described
it as a black zeolite. In 1794 it was analysed by Gadolin,
who declared it to be a silicate of iron, aluminium, and a
new element which he called Ytterbium. In 1797 Ekeberg
examined it, and confirmed the discovery. He proposed the
name Gadolinite for the mineral, and Yttria for the new earth;
these names were accepted by Klaproth, who examined it with
Vauquelin in 1800, and by the French crystallographer Haüy.
In 1802 Ekeberg showed that the oxide originally taken for
alumina was in reality beryllia; in 1816 Berzelius showed
that ceria was present with the yttria.<a id="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> About 1838 Mosander
began his classical work on the earths in gadolinite. In that
year he announced the separation of Lanthana,<a id="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and in 1842
that of Didymia, which he had actually discovered eighteen
months earlier. In the latter year he announced<a id="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the separation
of erbia and terbia. In 1842 also Scheerer<a id="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> declared that
the yttria from gadolinite was a mixture of earths, from its
different behaviour on heating in closed and open vessels;
but when Mosander announced the discovery of didymia (the
announcement appears to have been hastened indeed by
Scheerer’s observation) it was agreed that the colouration
observed was probably due to that earth. The further history
of these earths must be continued elsewhere (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page111">p. 111</a>).</p>

<p>The behaviour of gadolinite on heating is of great interest.
When heated uniformly, in closed or open vessels, the mineral
suddenly glows very strongly at a definite temperature (according
to Hofmann and Zerban<a id="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> at 430°C.), with considerable
alteration in properties. The amorphous variety exhibits
the phenomenon much more markedly than the crystalline
form. The change in the two cases is entirely distinct, the
only effect in common being that both varieties are rendered
insoluble in acids after the glowing. The amorphous variety,
in the act of glowing, changes to the crystalline form.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of phosphorescence, or glowing, on
heating, with a change in properties, was first observed by
Berzelius in 1816. He found that the oxides of many metals,
<i>e.g.</i> chromium, tantalum, and rhodium, became denser and
insoluble in acids after being heated. Later in the same year
he observed the glowing, with a similar change in properties,
in the case of a gadolinite from Fahlun.<a id="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Apparently without
knowledge of this observation, Wollaston published a similar
account of the glowing of a gadolinite in 1825. In 1840
Scheerer noted an almost identical change in the case of the
mineral <a href="#Ref33">allanite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Scheerer made a careful study of the
phenomena in the cases of allanite and gadolinite.<a id="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In each
case he found that the variety of lower specific gravity showed,
on heating, a very strong phosphorescence, accompanied by
change of colour and optical properties, and a marked increase
of specific gravity. Gadolinite suffered no appreciable loss
of weight, but allanite had lost a little water after the change.
Careful measurement of the specific gravity before and after
the change showed, in the case of two varieties of gadolinite
and one of allanite, that the volume had decreased in the
ratio 1&nbsp;: 0·94. Scheerer assumed that this ratio was constant
for all such cases, and advanced a general explanation. We
know now that numerous cases of similar phenomena occur,
in which the change of volume is quite different; but Scheerer’s
explanation is so ingenious, and so foreshadows some modern
theories, that it is given here in full.</p>

<p>He ascribes the alteration to ‘interatomic change, involving
change of relative position of atoms and decrease of
interatomic distances.’ (Scheerer and the chemists of that
period understood by atoms the ultimate particles of a body,
making no distinction between elements and compounds; in
this case he meant by atoms what we mean by molecules,
and the word ‘molecule’ has therefore been substituted for
‘atom’ in what follows.) The change is simply one of closer
packing of the molecules, which take up a more stable position
with liberation of energy as heat and light. He imagines<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
his molecules as uniform spheres arranged in horizontal layers,
as shown in <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>. In placing one layer vertically over
another there are three possible arrangements, of which only
two concern us. In the arrangement for closest packing,
B, say, a molecule of any one layer touches three molecules
in each of the layers above and below, which with the six it
touches in its own layer make twelve altogether. In the next
closest arrangement, A, say, a molecule of any one layer
touches only two molecules in each of the layers above and
below it, so that one molecule is in contact with ten others
altogether.</p>

H. Rose<a id="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> found
that <a href="#Ref37">samarskite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) exhibited the phenomenon
of glowing, but that the specific gravity was actually
less after the change than it was before, <i>i.e.</i> there was an
increase of volume. Damour observed glowing in the case of
<a href="#Ref38">zircon</a> from Ceylon (<i>q.v.</i>) with increase of density, the volume
change being from 1 to 0·922, <i>i.e.</i> even greater than for gadolinite.
Again, Hauser<a id="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> observed in the case of his new rare
earth mineral risörite a sudden change at a red heat, the
mineral losing water, becoming very brittle, and increasing
very considerably in specific gravity (the volume changing
from 1 to 0·90 approximately), but without glowing. Ramsay
and Travers<a id="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> found
that <a href="#Ref39">fergusonite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>) glowed strongly
when heated to 500°-600°, with decrease of specific gravity
(5·62 before to 5·37 after), evolution of all its helium, and
very considerable evolution of heat; they suggested that
helium was present in combination, in an endothermic compound
decomposed by heat, but in view of the properties of
helium, this hypothesis seems hardly tenable.</p>

<p>It appears unlikely that any one explanation can cover
all these interesting facts; there are in each case peculiar
factors to be taken into account. In 1841, Regnault,<a id="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> considering
the case of the oxides observed by Berzelius, inferred
that the development of light and heat denoted that the bodies
possessed a lower specific heat after the change than before.
The experimental difficulties encountered in attempting to dry
the oxides prevented him from confirming this view. He
measured the specific heats of the minerals calcite and aragonite
(CaCO₃), and of the two allotropic modifications of phosphorus,
but could observe no appreciable differences. H. Rose (<i><a href="#Ref40">vide
supra</a></i>) showed by experiment that considerable heat was
evolved on the glowing of gadolinite, with a decrease of about
one-fourteenth in the specific heat. In the case of samarskite
there was, however, no appreciable evolution of heat, nor could
he determine any difference in the specific heats before and
after glowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span></p>

<p>Probably the only inference that can be safely drawn is that
in most cases the change is due to some molecular re-arrangement.
The evolution of water, helium, etc., in some cases,
may possibly be due to intramolecular change, but on the
one hand the current view at present is that the helium is
mechanically held in radio-active minerals, and on the other
hand it is not known that the water evolved is water of constitution;
in an intermolecular change at fairly high temperature,
these might be evolved without disruption of the
true mineral molecules. The question of the energy involved,
and consequently of the specific heats, appears to depend on
factors peculiar to each case, of which at present no accurate
conception can be formed; and the change in specific gravity
is probably bound up with these. The loss of solubility in
acids is a factor not always connected with glowing, as it is
frequently observed in the laboratory after ignition of compounds,
but here again no adequate explanation is forthcoming.</p>

<p>The possibility of chemical change in one or two cases,
however, must not be ignored. Thus ammonium magnesium
phosphate, NH₄MgPO₄, on heating glows, and is converted
to magnesium pyrophosphate, according to the equation:</p>

<p class="equation">2NH₄MgPO₄ = Mg₂P₂O₇ + H₂O + 2NH₃</p>

<p>A case possibly analogous to this is that of the mineral
<a href="#Ref41">sipylite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), R´´´₂Cb₂O₈, with ‘basic water’ (<i>i.e.</i> R´´´ partially
replaced by H). Before the blowpipe this decrepitates with
loss of water, and glows brilliantly. The specific gravity after
the change does not appear to have been determined. Mallet
explains the glow as due to a change to the pyrocolumbate.</p>

<p>Similar explanations may possibly hold in the cases of
allanite and risörite, but it must be remembered that we are
really ignorant of the part played by the water in these minerals.</p>

<p>Allanite is of very wide distribution, though it is not often
found in large quantities. The usual occurrence in pegmatitic
veins in granites, syenites and other acid plutonic rocks has
been often noted, <i>e.g.</i> in many parts of Sweden and Norway.
It is found also in the extinct crater now forming the Laacher
See, near Coblenz, Germany, and at Impilaks, near Lake
Ladoga, on the border of Finland; a mass of the pure mineral
weighing 300 lb. was recently discovered at Barringer Hill,
(cf. <a href="#Ref43">under Gadolinite</a>), and it occurs in large quantities in
Amherst Co., Virginia. It is an accessory constituent of many
acid volcanic and hypabyssal rocks, and has been found also
in limestone, and in magnetic iron ores. On account of its
exceedingly wide distribution, and the variations in appearance
and composition, it has been repeatedly described under
various names, varieties being constantly mistaken for new
mineral species.</p>

<p>Its history is rather curious.<a id="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In 1806 the Danish mineralogist
Giesecke made a protracted voyage to Greenland, collecting
minerals and rocks; he remained there until 1813. In 1808
he sent off his first collection by ship to Copenhagen; on the
voyage the ship was taken by an English privateer, and the
cargo landed and sold at Leith. The minerals were bought
by Allan, a Scotch mineralogist, who recognised, that they
were from Greenland by the presence of cryolite, at that time
only known to occur in Greenland. He mistook the mineral
subsequently named after him for gadolinite, and sent it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
Thomson for analysis.<a id="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Thomson recognised it as a new
mineral, and named it Allanite (1810). In 1815 Hisinger
described a mineral from Ryddarhyttan, Sweden, which he
called Cerin; Leonhard (1821) and Hauy (1822) showed that
this was identical with Allanite. In 1818 Berzelius described
two varieties of a mineral from Finbo, near Fahlun, Sweden,
which he called Orthite, and Pyrorthite; these were eventually
shown by Scheerer (1844) to be varieties of Allanite. In 1824
the French mineralogist Lévy described a mineral from
Arendal, Norway, which he named Bucklandite, in honour of
the English naturalist; in 1825 this was identified with a
‘black zeolite’ from the Laacher See by G. Rose, and in 1828
both were shown by Hermann to have the same composition
as orthite or allanite. The list might be extended at will;
the Tautolite of Kokscharow (1847), the Bodenite of Breithaupt
(1844), the Muromontite of Kemdt (1848), and the Vasite of
Bahr (1863) have all been shown to be varieties of the same
bewildering mineral.</p>

<p>Thorite contains from 1·4 to 3·1 per cent. of rare earths.
According to Nilson and Blomstrand, the uranium is present
as uranium dioxide, UO₂ replacing thoria, ThO₂, but Dunstan
and Blake state that the two oxides are isomorphous (see
under Thorianite, <a href="#Page74">p. 74</a>), and so they might be expected to
be vicarious. Thorite was discovered by Esmark in 1828,
and first analysed by Berzelius,<a id="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> who announced the discovery
of a new earth in it in 1829. The name Thorite is from Thor,

<p>Thorite is a member of a peculiarly interesting series of
isomorphous minerals, which includes Cassiterite (SnO₂),
Rutile (TiO₂), Zircon (ZrSiO₄), and most probably the allied
silicate Naegite, and the rare earth phosphate <a href="#Ref45">Xenotime</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>), which are very similar in forms and angles. The oxide
TiO₂ is itself trimorphous, being known in the three crystallographically
different forms, <a href="#Ref46">Rutile</a>, <a href="#Ref47">Anatase</a>, and <a href="#Ref48">Brookite</a>
(<i>q.v.</i>). On account of the isomorphism of cassiterite and
rutile with the two silicates, it has been suggested that the
oxide formulæ be doubled and written Sn(SnO₄) and Ti(TiO₄)
respectively,<a id="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to show the analogy with Th(SiO₄) and Zr(SiO₄).
Consideration of the molecular volumes (obtained by dividing
molecular weight by specific gravity, <i>i.e.</i> multiplying by
specific volume) lends a certain amount of support to this
view. It has often been observed that isomorphous compounds,
and many compounds which occur in parallel growth
to one another, have nearly equal molecular volumes; there
are, however, many exceptions. Taking molecular volumes
for the series under consideration, we have, using approximate
numbers only&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be seen that if the numbers for cassiterite and rutile
be doubled, four out of the five show very fair approximation
to the constant value 40. The number 60 for thorite is
quite irreconcilable with the values obtained from the other
members; of course pure silicate of thorium, ThSiO₄, is not
known as a mineral, but it is most unlikely that the relatively
small amount of impurity in the densest specimens of orangite
should have depressed the specific gravity by over two units,
as would be required if the molecular volume of thorite were
to show even the most approximate semblance of agreement
with the others. It cannot be too often remarked, however,
that very little indeed is known of the molecular formulas of
minerals, and that very little reliance can be placed on such<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
figures as the above. On the contrary, it is hardly conceivable
that amphoteric oxides like those of tin and titanium, occurring
in the form of heavy crystalline minerals, should have molecular
formulæ only double the empirical formulæ. Where agreements
of the kind do occur, they must be taken as indicating
approximately equal degrees of molecular complexity in the
minerals concerned, rather than as affording any real insight
into the molecular condition.</p>

<p>It is infusible before the blowpipe, but loses its colour;
some varieties glow and increase in density (see <a href="#Page38">p. 38</a>). In
some varieties also the colour changes or disappears rapidly
on exposure to sunlight, and is often restored on keeping in
the dark. These phenomena of colour change have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
attributed variously to alteration in the state of oxidation of
the iron present, and to the presence of organic matter. It
seems probable that either cause or even both may be at the

<p>On account of the hardness, unalterability, and strong

<p>Artificial crystals of zircon have been obtained by the
action of silicon tetrachloride and silicon tetrafluoride on
zirconia, and by the action of zirconium tetrafluoride on silica
at high temperatures.</p>

<p>Zircon is one of the most widely distributed minerals
known, though usually it occurs in very small quantities.
Good crystals have been found in New Zealand, in Ceylon, at
Miask in the Urals, and in North Carolina. This last deposit
has been worked commercially for the extraction of zirconia
for Nernst lamps (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page320">p. 320</a>). It occurs in a decomposed
felspar in a pegmatite dyke in the Archæan gneiss near Zirconia,
Henderson Co., and can be easily extracted by picking or
washing, after crushing if necessary. Should there ever be a
considerable demand for zirconia, it could doubtless be saved
as a by-product in the extraction of thoria from <a href="#Page90">monazite
sands</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), zircon being very generally found in those sands
(see <a href="#Ref72">below</a>).</p>

<p id="Ref72">Zircon is common in crystalline rocks, limestones, schists,
syenites, granites, etc. It is a constant accessory constituent
in the acid igneous rocks, especially in the more acid eruptive
rocks. It is readily detected under the microscope by the
pleochroic haloes with which the tiny crystals are surrounded;
these have been shown by Joly to be due to alteration of the
surrounding rock by the radiations emitted by the radio-active
constituents of the zircon. It also occurs as a constituent of
those sands which are formed by the erosion of the igneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
rocks in which it is enclosed, and hence it almost invariably
accompanies monazite in the so-called monazite sands.</p>

<p>Zircon is one of the least easily altered minerals; by the
prolonged action of chalybeate and other waters, during many
geological ages, however, it gradually changes, losing silica
and gaining lime, oxides of iron, and water. Some of these
altered varieties have received special names, as, <i>e.g.</i> Auerbachite,
Malacone, Cyrtolite, and Alvite; but none of them

formula R´₄R´´₃Zr(SiO₃)₇, where R = (Na,K,H),
R´´ = (Ca,Fe,Mn,CeOH), and Zr(OCl) may partly function
as an acid in place of SiO₂. The true formula, however, is
quite uncertain, as the zirconia may function either as an
acidic or basic oxide. The fact that a mineral of such exceedingly

<p>The double refraction is strong, being positive for eudialyte,
negative for the Norwegian variety, eucolyte. From careful
microscopic examination, Ramsay has found that zones of
positive and negative birefringence, as well as isotropic (singly-refracting)
zones can occur on the same crystal, and he suggests
that the mineral is really composed of two isomorphous compounds
forming mixtures. In view of the continuous variation
of optical properties in an isomorphous series like the felspars,
such an explanation seems doubtful. The optical behaviour
of minerals is very often anomalous, and the phenomena in
this case are probably due to repeated twinning, with some
alteration in the double refraction, or to the lamellar intergrowth
of two varieties having slightly different optical
properties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span></p>

<p>On heating, the mineral evolves moisture and readily

<p>It is found in Greenland, usually embedded in felspar, in

<p>The mineral is fusible before the blowpipe, and is decomposed
by hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>It was named by Scheerer in 1844 from its composition,
and by Ekeberg in the same year in honour of the Norwegian
geologist Keilhau.</p>

<h5 class="inline" id="Ref76"><b>Titanite or Sphene.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;This species, important as an accessory
mineral of many rocks, is a titano-silicate of calcium,
generally containing small quantities of aluminium and iron.
The approximate formula usually given, CaTiSiO₅, is unsatisfactory;
some specimens contain as much as 7 per cent.
of ferric oxide, others up to 2 per cent. of manganese, whilst
the percentage of titanium oxide, TiO₂, varies very considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
(30 to 45 per cent.). Zambonini and Nickolan have
independently analysed specimens for which no satisfactory
formulæ could be deduced. For specimens containing trivalent
metals, Groth considers the mineral to be an isomorphous
mixture of CaTiSiO₅ and R´´´₂SiO₅ (see under <a href="#Ref51">Yttrotitanite</a>,
above); Blomstrand, however, advances the formula
2(R´´R´´´₂O₂,TiO)O,SiO₂, where TiO is basic, and the trivalent
metals occur in the divalent group R´´´₂O₂; this formula is
also supported by Zambonini.</p>

<p>More recently the problem of the constitution has been
attacked by Bruckmoser, using Tschermak’s method of determining
the nature of the salts present in silicates. In this
method, the mineral is digested with hydrochloric acid, at a
temperature not greater than 60°, until decomposition is
complete; the silicic acid formed is washed by decantation,
and dried in air at a constant temperature; it is weighed at
regular intervals until the weight is constant. It is stated
that if a curve of times and weights be plotted, a break is
observed at the point where drying ceases (for the acid is of
course wet) and decomposition begins; the composition at
this point, which is taken as the composition of the acid required,
can be determined from the weight of the acid, and
the weight of anhydrous silica present, which is determined
by ignition after the weight has become constant.</p>

<p>Employing this method in the case of titanite, Bruckmoser
claims to have obtained the acids H₂Si₂O₅ and H₂Ti₂O₅. He
therefore concludes that the constitution of the mineral is
represented by the formula Si₂O₅,Ti₂O₅Ca, which presumably
may be written Ca(Ti,Si)₂O₅.</p>

resinous. The colour varies very much, doubtless with the
content of iron and manganese; it is commonly yellow,
green, or brown. Pleochroism is very distinct. The
refraction and dispersion are very high, giving the facetted
stone a ‘fire’ inferior only to that of diamond. Birefringence
positive, strong; the axial angles vary very widely
in different specimens.</p>

</div><!--details-->

<p>It is fusible with difficulty before the blowpipe. Hot
concentrated hydrochloric acid decomposes it partially, with
separation of silica; boiling sulphuric acid, or, better, fused
potassium hydrogen sulphate, decomposes it completely.</p>

<p>On account of the high dispersion and refractive index,
clear specimens of sphene make very beautiful gems, but the
stone is not sufficiently hard to stand much wear.</p>

<p>The mineral was discovered in Chamouni by Pictet in 1787,
and was named Pictite by Delamètherie (1797). In 1795
Klaproth analysed a specimen from Passau, and, observing
the presence of titanium (which he had just discovered in
rutile), proposed the name Titanite. The mineral described
by de Saussure (1796) as ‘Schorl rayonnante,’ and afterwards
by Hauy (1801) as Sphene (σφήν = a wedge), was shown to be
identical in composition with titanite by Cordier, and also
by Klaproth (1810); the crystallographic identity was proved
by G. Rose (1820).</p>

<p>On account of the difference in colour and composition,
a large number of varieties are distinguished. The ordinary
yellow and brown varieties are known indifferently as sphene
or titanite. <i>Ligurite</i> has an apple-green colour; <i>Semeline</i> is
a greenish form named from a fancied resemblance to flax
seed. <i>Lederite</i> is a brown variety of tabular habit; <i>Greenovite</i>
is rose-coloured, and contains manganese. <i>Alshedite</i> and
<i>Eucolite-Titanite</i> are rich in the trivalent metals; <i>Grothite</i> is
a brown variety containing a considerable percentage of ferric
iron. <i>Yttrotitanite</i>, which contains a high proportion of rare
earths, is usually treated as a separate species (see <a href="#Ref51">above</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
<i>Titanomorphite</i> and <i>Leucoxene</i> are white amorphous varieties
chiefly produced by alteration of rutile and ilmenite.</p>

<p>Titanite is a fairly widespread mineral; as an accessory
rock constituent it is common in the massive plutonic rocks
in tiny crystals, readily distinguished under the microscope
by the high refraction and birefringence, whilst in large embedded
crystals it occurs in many granular limestones, and in
plutonic acid, as well as in some metamorphic rocks. In good
crystals it is found in many parts of Switzerland and the Alps,
in Dauphiné, the Tyrol, Piedmont, the Urals, South Norway,
and other European localities; it is also widely distributed
in the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>The mineral is important as a valuable source of titanium.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">The class of Titano-silicates is a very large one, and might
be extended almost at will by the inclusion of the numerous
silicates which contain titanium. Owing to the frequency
with which small quantities of silica are replaced by titanium
dioxide, almost all the commoner silicate minerals contain
the latter oxide, so that titanium is one of the most widely
distributed of the elements. Relatively very few, however,
of the titanium-bearing minerals contain the element in
considerable quantities, and only two or three have any importance
as commercial sources of titanium compounds.</p>

<p>Only those additional titano-silicates which contain titanium
as an important constituent are mentioned below; short
accounts will be found in the alphabetical <a href="#Ref34">list</a>.</p>

<p><i>Johnstrupite</i>, <i>Mosandrite</i>, <i>Rinkite</i>, <i>Rosenbuschite</i> and <i>Tscheffkinite</i>

<p><i>Astrophyllite</i>, <i>Leucosphenite</i>, <i>Molengraafite</i>, <i>Neptunite</i> and
<i>Rhönite</i> are complex titano-silicates free from rare earth
elements.</p>

<p><i>Benitoite</i> is a simple titano-silicate of barium; <i>Ænigmatite</i>
and <i>Narsarsukite</i> contain iron and sodium; <i>Lorenzenite</i> has
sodium and zirconium. <i>Schorlomite</i> is a titaniferous garnet.

<h5 class="inline"><b>Ilmenite or Menaccanite</b> (Specular Iron Ore, Titaniferous
Ironstone, etc.).</h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;This is a titanate of iron, usually written
FeTiO₃. Its constitution has given rise to very considerable
discussion<a id="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; not only do the relative proportions of iron
and titanium vary greatly, but the iron is undoubtedly present
in both the ferrous and the ferric states, and in the former
state is partly replaced in some specimens by manganese
and magnesium. In 1829 Mosander put forward the view
that the mineral consisted of FeTiO₃, ferrous titanate, with
varying proportions of ferric oxide, the forms and angles of
ilmenite being very similar to those of hæmatite, Fe₂O₃. This
view was disputed by H. Rose, who concluded that the mineral
must have been originally an isomorphous mixture of ferric
oxide, Fe₂O₃, and titanic oxide, Ti₂O₃, which on exposure to
high temperature in the earth’s crust would change according
to the equation</p>

<p class="equation">Fe₂O₃ + Ti₂O₃ = 2TiO₂ + 2FeO</p>

<p class="noindent">so that the proportion of ferrous iron increases with the proportion
of titanium dioxide, as is actually found to be the
case. This condition, however, is also satisfied by Mosander’s
view. The latter view was also supported by Rammelsberg,
who pointed out that the presence of magnesium indicated the
existence of ferrous iron as a primary constituent. Additional
support is lent to this view by the discovery of Pyrophanite,
MnTiO₃ (see <a href="#Ref34">list</a>), which is found to be isomorphous with
ilmenite, so that there can be little doubt that MgTiO₃, which
can be only a titanate, would, if it existed in the crystalline
form (see <a href="#Ref55">Geikielite in list</a>), also be isomorphous with ilmenite.
Friedel and Guérin (1876) prepared artificial titanium sesquioxide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
Ti₂O₃, and found it to be isomorphous with hæmatite,
Fe₂O₃; they concluded that FeFeO₃, FeTiO₃ and TiTiO₃
formed an isomorphous series, and that ilmenite was a mixture
of the second with the other two. In 1890 Hamberg pointed
out that there was no reason to suppose that hæmatite, Fe₂O₃,
contains ferrous iron, <i>i.e.</i> has the constitution Fe´´Fe<sup>iv</sup>O₃,
analogous to Fe´´Ti<sup>iv</sup>O₃, since in corundum, the analogous
compound of aluminium, Al₂O₃, divalent aluminium can hardly
exist; nevertheless, strict analogy of constitution is not
necessary for isomorphism, as shown by the case of potassium
nitrate, KNO₃, and aragonite, CaCO₃, so that hæmatite, Fe₂O₃,
and ferrous titanate, FeTiO₃, might form solid solutions in
varying proportions without the strictly analogous formula
FeFeO₃ being true for the former. The balance of opinion
inclines to the constitution (<i>m</i>FeTiO₃ + <i>n</i>Fe₂O₃ in isomorphous
mixture) originally proposed by Mosander. The evidence in
support of this view has been greatly strengthened by the
recent work of Manchot,<a id="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which has proved the absence of
titanium sesquioxide, Ti₂O₃; the mineral is therefore to be
regarded as a titanate.</p>

<p>Before the blowpipe it fuses at the edges; with borax it
gives an iron bead. It is decomposed by boiling concentrated
sulphuric acid, better by fusion with potassium hydrogen
sulphate, and leaching the residue with dilute hydrochloric

heating it glows, with decrease in specific gravity (cf. <a href="#Page38">p. 38</a>).</p>

<p>Samarskite occurs with other columbo-tantalates in felspar,
or in veins in granite, near Miask in the Urals, near Quebec

<p>Euxenite and Polycrase are members of an isomorphous

of the series is that of mixed columbates and titanates of yttria
earths (with, as usual, some ceria earths), with uranium and
zirconium, and water. Before the isomorphous relation was
recognised, Rammelsberg gave for Euxenite the formula
R´´´(CbO₃)₃,R´´´₂(TiO₃)₃,1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>H₂O. The ratio of the acidic oxides,
Cb₂O₅&nbsp;: TiO₂, is here 1&nbsp;: 2. This is the greatest value of the
ratio, which varies for the series between 1&nbsp;: 2 and 1&nbsp;:
5.<a id="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The
end members, the pure metacolumbate and pure metatitanate
respectively, are unknown; all the members occurring in
nature are to be regarded as mixtures of these within the
limits set by the ratios <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub>.
Brögger<a id="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> suggests that
the name Euxenite be retained for all members for which the
ratio is between <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub>, whilst for those minerals in which
it is less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> the name Polycrase be kept; these views
have been supported by Lange, who has analysed members
of the series.</p>

<p>The members of this isomorphous series, however, are
themselves dimorphous, that is, can each crystallise in two
different ways. The second form corresponding to the
Euxenites is known as Priorite, whilst that corresponding to
Polycrase is known as Blomstrandine; and these second forms
are themselves members of a parallel isomorphous series of
the same chemical composition, of course, as the first series.
It is, perhaps, undesirable to cite this as a typical example of
an isodimorphous series, since no end members of unmixed
composition are known. A perfect example of such a series
is furnished by the oxides of antimony and arsenic. Each of
these compounds exists in two distinct crystalline varieties,
antimony trioxide, Sb₂O₃, as Valentinite (orthorhombic) and
Senarmontite (cubic), arsenic trioxide, As₂O₃, as Claudetite
(orthorhombic) and Arsenolite (cubic); and these two modifications<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
are isomorphous with one another, senarmontite
with arsenolite, and valentinite with claudetite.</p>

<p>In the case we are considering, the name Euxenite is applied
to one crystalline modification (A) of a number of isomorphous
compounds within certain limits of composition, the name
Priorite to the second crystalline modification (B) of the same
compounds; the name Polycrase is applied to compounds
having the crystal form A, and a composition varying within
a second set of limits in the same chemical series, whilst this
second set of compounds in the crystalline form B is known as
Blomstrandine.</p>

<p>Stated as concisely as possible, the relationship is as follows:
Each member of this chemical series of continuously varying
composition can crystallise in two forms, which are the same
for every member. The two varieties at one end of the
series are called euxenite and priorite, at the other end
polycrase and blomstrandine.</p>

<p>Thus, whilst euxenite and priorite, at the one end, and
polycrase and blomstrandine at the other, have the same
compositions, euxenite and polycrase have the same crystalline
form, whilst priorite and blomstrandine have the same second
crystalline form.</p>

<p>All four minerals have the same bright black appearance,
and bright conchoidal fracture; they are all four isotropic,
probably as a result of hydration. All are orthorhombic, but
the measurements for euxenite and polycrase are different
from those for blomstrandine and priorite. The two latter
are not so widely distributed as the two former. Blomstrandine
occurs at Hitterö, Arendal, and other localities in Norway;
priorite is found in Swaziland, South Africa.</p>

<p>The crystal system of the Polycrase-Euxenite series is
orthorhombic, but Dana gives slightly different axial ratios
for the two minerals. This, though Brögger gives the same
values for both, is by no means incompatible with isomorphism,
as a glance at the axial ratios for the minerals aragonite,
strontianite, witherite, etc., of the series of the orthorhombic
carbonates, will show.</p>

<p>Brögger’s ratios for the two are <i>a</i>&nbsp;: <i>b</i>&nbsp;: <i>c</i> =
0·3789&nbsp;: 1<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>&nbsp;:
0·3527; Dana gives for polycrase 0·3462&nbsp;: 1&nbsp;: 0·3124, for
euxenite 0·364&nbsp;: 1&nbsp;: 0·303.</p>

<p>The Euxenite-Polycrase series was studied by Hauser and
Wirth in 1909,<a id="FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> in an endeavour to establish their theory
that the proportions in which the various earths and acids
occur in this group of minerals is subject to definite laws
beyond the ordinary laws of combination. Thus of the erbia
earths they state that the proportion of holmia and dysprosia
increases relatively to erbia as titanium dioxide increases,
<i>i.e.</i> as we pass from the euxenites to the polycrases; at the
same time scandia and yttria increase relatively to the other
yttria earths (the terbia group), whilst in the ceria group
samaria and praseodymia decrease relatively to the others.
Thus samaria is found in appreciable quantities only when
the titanium content is low. The original paper must be
consulted for full details.</p>

<p>It was stated above that zirconium was found in euxenite
in 1879. In 1901 Hofmann and Prandtl<a id="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> declared that
zirconia was an unfailing constituent of the mineral, and that
it was always accompanied by a new oxide, which they named
Euxenia (‘Euxenerde’). This was characterised by the
solubility of its oxalate in acid solutions, the insolubility of<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
the precipitated hydroxide in excess of alkali, and the gradual
precipitation by hydrogen peroxide from a slightly acid solution
of its salts. In their paper quoted above, Hauser and Wirth
state that zirconia is never present in typical euxenites. In
a second paper<a id="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> they state that after exhaustive treatment
of every known zirconia mineral, they can find no trace whatever
of the ‘new earth,’ and conclude that Hofmann and
Prandtl must have made some experimental error. During
this examination, they observed radioactivity in some minerals
which contained no traces of uranium or thorium.</p>

Norway, North Carolina, etc.; as a secondary species it
occurs in the massive and hydrated form, with ores of lead,
silver, tin, etc., in Saxony and Cornwall, and at the celebrated
mine of Joachimsthal, in Bohemia. The latter

<p>Several varieties of uraninite have been distinguished by
special names. Crystalline varieties from Anneröd and
Arendal in Norway are known as Bröggerite and Cleveite
respectively; Nivenite is a third form. In these varieties
uranium oxides have been replaced to a considerable extent
by the rare earths and thoria. An amorphous variety of
doubtful composition, produced by alteration, is known as
Gummite; Uranosphærite is a similar altered form.</p>

<p>The composition has been accounted for (Dunstan and
Jones, <i>loc. cit.</i>) on the hypothesis that thoria (ThO₂) and
uranous oxide (UO₂) are isomorphous, the mineral being really
a solid solution. Whilst, however, the crystal system of the
natural body is really rhombohedral (<i><a href="#Ref58">vide infra</a></i>) the two pure
oxides appear to be cubic. Thus Troost and Ouvrard<a id="FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> obtained
artificial thoria in minute octahedra; and, similarly,
Hillebrand<a id="FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> obtained uranous oxide in octahedra by reduction
of uranyl chloride, UO₂Cl₂, though his work seems to be
open to objection. On the other hand, the same author<a id="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
found that uranous oxide and thoria, fused together in almost
any proportions, gave a homogeneous body crystallising in
octahedra (cf. Szilard, <i>Compt. rend.</i> 1907, <b>145</b>, 463, <a href="#Footnote79">quoted</a> under
Uraninite). The probability of the isomorphism of the oxides
is strengthened by the observation of isomorphism in the
sulphates. As early as 1886, Rammelsberg showed that
uranous sulphate, U(SO₄)₂, crystallises with nine molecules of
water and is isomorphous with the corresponding thorium
sulphate, Th(SO₄)₂,9H₂O; and six years later, Hillebrand
and Melville<a id="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> obtained mixed crystals of the two sulphates
which were exceedingly close in forms and angles to those of
pure uranous sulphate. It is then at least probable that the
two oxides are isomorphous, though the point cannot be
regarded as satisfactorily proved, by reason of the anomalous
crystal forms of the naturally occurring mixtures, thorianite
and uraninite. The recent results of Kobayashi<a id="FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> point to the
conclusion that different varieties of thorianite may exist,
in each of which the oxides of thorium and uranium bear
definite simple ratios to one another.</p>

however, that twinning can only take place about one of
the four diagonals, and an optical examination makes it
clear that the symmetry is really rhombohedral. The case
is exactly analogous to that of the mineral chabazite, a
zeolite which occurs in rhombohedra of which the angles differ
but little from those of the cube, and which also forms the
interpenetrant twins. In view of the fact that both uranous
oxide and thoria have been obtained as octahedra, whilst
a fused mixture of the two on cooling forms cubic crystals,
it seems not unlikely that at high temperatures the pseudocubic
thorianite would become truly cubic; but no experiments

<p>The so-called Synchisite was discovered by Nordenskiöld
who correctly described it as Parisite. Flink found it in
Greenland, and announced it as a new species, with the
formula R₂F₂Ca₂(CO₃)₄, <i>i.e.</i> the formula for parisite plus one
molecule of calcium carbonate, CaCO₃. From its extraordinary
resemblance to parisite in physical and crystallographic
properties, Palache and Warren<a id="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> believe that the specimens
selected by Flink for analysis must have consisted, in reality,
of parisite with admixed calcium carbonate. This conclusion
has now been confirmed by Quercigh, by a careful comparison
of the optical properties.<a id="FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The minerals are usually found
together, the chief localities being S. Norway, the gold districts
of the Urals, Narsarsuk in S. Greenland, and Montana, U.S.A.</p>

<p>Monazite is with difficulty soluble in acids; before the
blowpipe it is infusible; when moistened with sulphuric acid
it colours the flame greenish-blue.</p>

<p>The mineral often occurs massive, yielding angular fragments,
but is most common in rolled grains. It occurs in the
gneiss of the Carolinas and Georgia, and in sands derived
from the gneiss, in Idaho and many of the Pacific States;
in Brazil, at various localities in the provinces of Minas Geraes,
Bahia, Espirito Santo; in Queensland, Australia; in Madagascar;
in Ceylon; near Travancore in India; in the Urals;
in Scandinavia, etc. The deposits of commercial value will
be treated more fully in the next chapter. It is of wide distribution
as an accessory constituent of granites, diorites,
and gneisses.</p>

<p>Monazite was first described, under the name Turnerite,
by Lévy,<a id="FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> in 1823; the specimen was from the collection of
the English chemist Turner, who thought it a variety of sphene
(titanite), and was named after him at the suggestion of the
mineralogist Heuland. The specimen was stated to have been
found in Dauphiné, but in spite of considerable examination
of the question, the precise locality is still unknown. The
resemblance between Turnerite and the mineral later described
as monazite (μοναζειν = to be solitary) was pointed out by<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
Dana in 1866, and confirmed by Pisani, 1877. The name
Monazite was first used by Breithaupt<a id="FNanchor104"></a><a href="#Footnote104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in describing a mineral
found by Menge (1826) accompanying zircon in a granite
from Miask in the Urals. Breithaupt concluded, from the
high specific gravity, that the mineral contained a heavy
metallic oxide. It was again described as Mengite by Brooke<a id="FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
in 1831. It was re-discovered by Shephard<a id="FNanchor106"></a><a href="#Footnote106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> in South Carolina
in 1837, and described by him under the name Edwardsite,
a variety from Connecticut being called Eremite. To Shephard
belongs the honour of having discovered its true nature;
after analysis he described it as a ‘Basic Sesquiphosphate of
the Protoxide of Cerium,’ giving the formula (modern notation)
3CeO,2P₂O₅, and finding also zirconia, alumina, and silica in
it (his specimen was probably very impure). Gustav Rose<a id="FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
showed this to be identical with monazite in 1840. In 1846
Wöhler described, under the name Cryptolite, a variety of
tetragonal habit closely resembling zircon. This occurs at
Arendal in Norway, enclosed by apatite, in the granite; it
may be obtained by treatment with dilute nitric acid, which
dissolves the apatite.</p>

<p>The question of the manner in which the thorium is combined
in monazite is of considerable importance, in view of
the fact that it is to this element that the mineral owes its
commercial value. The amount present varies from traces
up to over 20 per cent., but the usual value is between 5 and
7 per cent. The first explanation of its presence was advanced
by Dunnington<a id="FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> who suggested, on the result of only one
analysis, that orangite (ThSiO₄) was present mechanically
mixed with the monazite. Penfield<a id="FNanchor109"></a><a href="#Footnote109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> supported this suggestion,
and stated that in three analyses of pure material
he found the ratio of rare earths to phosphorus pentoxide
and that of thoria to silica exactly equal to unity, though the
actual amounts of thoria varied considerably. He also quotes<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
an analysis made by Rammelsberg in 1877, in which no thoria
was found, to show that it is not an essential constituent.
In a microscopic examination he found dark resinous particles
scattered throughout the section; after moistening with
hydrochloric acid, warming, and washing, these dark spots
became white, and could be stained with fuchsine, the monazite
remaining unaffected throughout. He concluded that these
particles were thorite or orangite.</p>

<p>Blomstrand<a id="FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> disputed Penfield’s conclusions. In twelve
analyses of monazite from various parts of Scandinavia he
never once found either thoria or silica absent. Of these
twelve analyses, two give the ratio of thoria to silica, ThO₂&nbsp;:
SiO₂, exactly unity, in seven cases the ratio is not greater
than 1·25, in five cases it varies considerably. He summed up
his results in three statements:</p>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Chemically this mineral is closely allied to
monazite, being an orthophosphate of rare earths, containing
silica and thoria; whereas, however, in monazite the content
of yttria earths does not rise above 4 per cent., in xenotime
these constitute by far the greater part of the bases, the content
of ceria earths ranging from 8·2 to 11 per cent. The yttria
earths, chiefly oxides of yttrium and the erbium group, vary
from 54·1 to 64·7 per cent. There are traces of zirconia;
Ramsay, Collie and Travers detected helium, whilst Boltwood,
and also Strutt, found uranium and radium. It also appears

<p>It is insoluble in acids, and infusible before the blowpipe;
when moistened with sulphuric acid, however, it turns the
flame bluish-green, like most mineral phosphates (<i>vide</i>
<a href="#Ref59">monazite</a>).</p>

<p>It is not so widely distributed as monazite, but is not
uncommon. It often occurs with zircon&mdash;to which it is very
closely allied in crystal form, if the two are not actually isomorphous&mdash;in
parallel growth, in granitic rocks. The diamond
sands of Diamantina, Brazil, form the richest source of the
mineral, but it is also found in Scandinavia, at Hitterö, Åro, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p>The mineral is of considerable importance, chemically, on
account of the high percentage of erbia earths.</p>

<p>In the works of Bauer, Rosenbusch, Weinschenk, Schilling
and Iddings will be found accounts of a mineral named
‘Hussakite.’ These accounts rested on the work of Kraus
and Reitinger,<a id="FNanchor112"></a><a href="#Footnote112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> who in 1901 announced the discovery of a new
species. The crystals were obtained as a specimen of xenotime
by Prof. Muthmann from Dr. E. Hussak, in São Paulo, and
had the crystallographic properties of that mineral. On
analysis, the amount of sulphur trioxide present was found to
be remarkably high (6·3 per cent.), and Kraus and Reitinger
concluded that the substance was distinct from xenotime.
They announced it as a new mineral, with the name Hussakite,
and the formula 3R₂O₃,3P₂O₅,SO₃ or 6RPO₄,SO₃, and stated
that by the action of dilute alkalies the sulphur trioxide could
be easily and completely removed. They therefore regarded
xenotime as a pseudomorph<a id="FNanchor113"></a><a href="#Footnote113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> after hussakite, the sulphur
trioxide having been removed from the latter by the action
of the alkaline waters of the earth’s crust. In support of this
view, they gave analyses of opaque crystals from a Bahia sand
represented as containing 2·6 to 2·7 per cent. of sulphur trioxide,
and so as being intermediate forms produced during the change.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote112"><a href="#FNanchor112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> <i>Zeitsch. Kryst. Min.</i> 1901, <b>34</b>, 268.</p>

<p id="Footnote113"><a href="#FNanchor113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a>
One mineral is said to be pseudomorphous after another when the first
is produced from the second by a chemical change which proceeds so slowly
that the original structure and crystalline form are unaltered (<i>i.e.</i> a change
proceeding molecule by molecule). The pseudomorph is usually opaque and
shows clear signs of the alteration.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The latter conclusion was quickly challenged by Brögger,
who found no sulphur trioxide in a perfectly fresh and transparent
xenotime from Åro in Scandinavia. Brögger concluded
that the Hussakite of Kraus and Reitinger was an independent
species of the formula 5YPO₄,(YSO₄)PO₃, and that xenotime
was not derived from it.</p>

<p>Basing his work on the barium chloride test given by
Kraus and Reitinger (see <a href="#Ref60">below</a>)
Rösler<a id="FNanchor114"></a><a href="#Footnote114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> declared that
‘Hussakite’ was a common accessory constituent of igneous
rocks, having been previously mistaken for zircon, which it
resembles in appearance and optical properties.</p>

<p id="Ref60">In 1907 Hussak<a id="FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> published a paper in which he showed
that the mineral named after him was not a new species at
all, but a xenotime of prismatic habit. Analyses made at his
request by Florence in Brazil, G. T. Prior in London, and
Tschernik in St. Petersburg, confirmed the original values
given by Gorceix (sulphur trioxide up to 0·25 per cent.). He
mentions Brögger’s analysis of the Norwegian specimen in
which Kraus and Reitinger had found 2-3 per cent. of sulphur
trioxide, but in which Brögger found none. He explains the
results of Kraus and Reitinger as due to the addition of barium
chloride to the acidified solution of the carbonate fusion of the
mineral, by which barium phosphate was precipitated; this
was dried and weighed as barium sulphate. Rösler’s tests
are declared doubtful; xenotime is not a widely spread rock
constituent, the mineral in question being really zircon.</p>

<p>In face of these results, there can be little doubt that the

<p>It is very similar to fluorspar (except that the octahedral
cleavage of the latter is very good), and is regarded by Vogt
as an isomorphous mixture of the latter with yttrium fluoride
(or with a double yttrium calcium fluoride, which is less
probable). This view would account for the variations in
composition, and also for the remarkable frequency with
which traces of rare earths are found in fluorspar (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page2">p. 2</a>).
Yttrocerite is regarded as a similar isomorphous mixture,
but containing cerium metals in addition to the yttrium group.</p>

<p>Yttrofluorite occurs in pegmatite veins in granite in Northern
Norway, with gadolinite, fergusonite, allanite, fluorspar, and
the usual vein minerals.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">The other members of this family (see <a href="#Ref35">list</a>) are:</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that fluorine is the only member of
the halogen family which occurs in nature in combination

the great age of the rare earth minerals, and their formation

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER VII</span><br />
THE MONAZITE SANDS</h3>

<p>It has been stated that monazite is a not uncommon
accessory constituent of many rocks, particularly of granites,
gneisses, diorites, etc. The crystalline material, of which an
account has been given, is found sometimes in veins in these
rocks, more often in tiny crystals disseminated throughout
the mass. Most of these monazite-bearing rocks are extremely
old, belonging to the Archæan or pre-Cambrian age, and
probably none are of secondary (Mesozoic) or later age. It
follows, then, that they have been subjected to erosion during
practically the whole immense period of which geology can
give us any detailed knowledge. Heat, frost, wind, the action
of vegetation and of percolating water, the innumerable
weathering agents known to the geologist, have been at work
on them during countless ages, breaking, crushing, dissolving;
rains, brooks, rivers, even ocean-waves have dissolved or
washed away the fragments, sorted them out unerringly
according to density, and re-deposited them, now in a river-bed,
now at the base of some sea cliff, now in a wide alluvial plain
from which the water has long since retired. It is in deposits
of this nature that the monazite has been concentrated. Its
relatively high specific gravity (about 5·0) has secured its
separation from the lighter mica, quartz, and felspar of the
parent-rock; but the heavier vein or accessory minerals have,
of course, been concentrated with it. Zircon is an invariable
constituent of these ‘monazite sands,’ as such deposits are
called; and others almost as frequently found are rutile,
ilmenite, sphene (titanite), and apatite. Common, too, are the
characteristic minerals of the metamorphic rocks, garnet,
epidote, sillimanite, tourmaline, etc. Rare earth minerals
found in the monazite sands include xenotime, fergusonite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
samarskite, gadolinite, and allanite. The remaining minerals
are oxides of iron and tin, with, of course, a considerable amount
of quartz.</p>

<p>It is apparent, from what has been said above, that monazite
will be concentrated with the heaviest constituents of the
rocks from which it is derived. Very often, indeed usually,
these rocks are precisely those in which gold occurs, disseminated
sometimes in tiny particles, sometimes collected into
nuggets in veins of quartz and pegmatitic minerals. The erosion
of these rocks concentrates the gold with the heaviest minerals;
and hence it happens that monazite is an almost universal
constituent of the gold- and gem-bearing sands and gravels.
In the Carolinas and in Brazil, monazite is found in the gold
washings; and though in the past the two have always been
extracted separately, the gold first and the monazite from the
washings or tailings, there appears to be no reason why a
system calculated to extract both&mdash;where, of course, the content
is high enough&mdash;should not be put into operation in the
future.</p>

<p>A chemical test affords the only reliable method of detecting
monazite in a sand. A little of the sand is washed with water
to remove the lighter minerals and warmed with concentrated
sulphuric acid. A few drops of the liquid are poured off,
evaporated to small bulk, and one drop placed on a glass
plate. This is placed under a microscope and one drop of
a concentrated solution of sodium acetate is added. If monazite
is present in the sand, tiny pointed oval crystals of sodium
cerium sulphate will separate.</p>

<p>On the commercial scale, monazite is extracted from the
sands only, in the manner described below. An effort was
made in North Carolina in 1906 by the British Monazite
Company, representing the South Metropolitan Gas Light
Company of London, to extract monazite from the rock in
which it occurs disseminated. The rock was crushed and
powdered, and the monazite separated by washing off the
lighter particles on concentration tables (see <a href="#Ref61">below</a>). In the
same year, however, the price of thorium nitrate was suddenly
lowered 50 per cent. by the German Thorium Syndicate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
which largely controls the Brazilian output of monazite, and
the British company stopped operations in 1907. At present
it may be said that only the sands are available for profitable
extraction.</p>

<p>Up to 1895, the Carolina deposits, which were worked
chiefly by the Welsbach Light Company of New York, either
directly or indirectly, supplied all the demand, but in that
year the Brazilian sands were first worked, and a keen struggle
commenced for the market. The American companies, after
keeping up a considerable output for some years, were forced
to suspend operations in May 1910. The Brazil deposits,
worked by the German Thorium Syndicate and the Austrian
Welsbach Company, which have an agreement, now meet
practically the whole demand. The Brazilian sand occurs
chiefly along the shores of the southern provinces, having
been concentrated by the action of the tides from the products
of erosion of the cliffs; it is very uniform and considerably
richer than the Carolina sand, and owing to its occurrence
on the sea-shore, the cost of transporting it is very low. It
is exported chiefly to Germany, recently also to the United
States, and to a small extent lately to England. The method
of working it is similar to that employed in Carolina&mdash;namely,
concentration by washing and magnetic separation.</p>

<p>There are two important regions in North America within
which monazite sands occur; one extends over the Carolinas,
and the north-western part of Georgia, the other over the
Idaho basin and neighbouring counties of the Pacific Slope.
It will be best to treat these separately, as the deposits are
somewhat different in character.</p>

<h5 class="inline">(<i>a</i>) <b>The Carolina Deposits</b></h5>

<p class="hinline unspaced">, including the unimportant
Georgia deposits, which belong to the same field, occur over
an area approaching 4000 square miles. The area is occupied
chiefly by the Piedmont plateau, which is drained by a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
of streams rising in the South Mountains, an eastern outlier
of the Blue Ridge; it is in the basins and valleys of these
streams, particularly at the head-waters, that the monazite
is chiefly found. The geology of the district is very complicated,<a id="FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
the rocks being very highly altered granites. The
chief bed is known as the Carolina gneiss, and includes several
types of gneiss, usually very much weathered. The sands,
which average about 1 per cent. of monazite, are worked in
and near the stream beds; they occur in the beds, and in
layers 1 to 2 feet in thickness a few feet below the surface
of the surrounding soil.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p id="Ref61">Concentration was formerly effected chiefly by a crude
process of washing. In this process the sand is thrown on
to a sort of sieve, fixed over the upper end of a long wooden
trough, by one workman; a jet of water is directed on to the
sieve, washing the sand through it. The heavier particles
fall to the bottom of the trough, whilst the lighter are washed
right through. A second workman continually turns over
the sand left in the box and on the sieve; at the end of a
day’s work the ‘concentrate’ is collected. This averages
from 15 to 70 per cent. of monazite, according to the nature
and amount of the heavy minerals accompanying it in the
sand. The concentrate is dried either on rubber or oiled
cloths in the sun, or on an iron plate covering a trough in
which a fire is lighted. The iron minerals are then picked
out by means of a magnet, and the sand filled into sacks for
transport.</p>

<p>Before treatment for thorium nitrate, the sand is at the
present day further concentrated by powerful magnetic
separators. In a few cases the older method of concentration
by hand-washing has been abandoned for machine concentration,
the Wilfley table being sometimes employed. The
principle here is exactly the same, the sand being fed into
a hopper by means of a moving belt and thence on to a
machine-shaken table from which running water constantly
removes the particles, sorting them according to their specific
gravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span></p>

<p>Further separation of the dried concentrate has been
effected by three kinds of separators.<a id="FNanchor121"></a><a href="#Footnote121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The first was of the
Edison, or fall-and-deflection type; in this the sand is allowed
to flow in a thin vertical stream past a horizontal magnet,
which deflects the minerals containing iron; these fall on
one side of a partition, the part richer in monazite on the other.
The second was an electrostatic machine; the heated sand
is borne on a moving belt underneath a rotating vulcanite
cylinder, excited by felt-covered rubbers; the lighter particles
are attracted to the cylinder, and dropped on one side, the
heavier passing on. Neither of these machines is of much
value in effecting concentration, and neither is in general use.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The third, and by far the most efficient and most widely-used
machine, is known as the Wetherill electro-magnetic
separator. It depends on the principle, first applied by the
American engineer Wetherill, that not only the iron minerals,
but a large number of other minerals may be attracted if the
magnetic field be sufficiently strong. In all types of this
machine used in cleaning monazite concentrates, four magnetic
fields of increasing intensity are traversed by the sand; the
first removes magnetite, ilmenite, and the larger fragments
of garnet; the second removes all the remaining garnet and
ilmenite; the third removes the coarser, and the fourth the
finer monazite, tailings of zircon, rutile, and silica passing on.
Careful adjustment of the magnetic fields will readily give a
97-99 per cent. monazite.</p>

<p>Two types of this machine are in common use. In the
first the magnetic fields are obtained by four successive electro-magnets,
arranged so that a broad horizontally-moving belt
passes between the poles of each in succession. The upper
poles are ground down to a fine edge perpendicular to the
direction of the belt, to secure a more powerful field. Just
beneath these edges, and just above the broad belt are four
rapidly driven horizontal belts moving at right angles to the
first or main belt; these carry off and deposit in separate bins
the minerals attracted by their respective magnets. This type
is known as the Rowand separator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span></p>

<p>In the second type four horizontal belts are arranged in
the form of descending steps, as shown in the diagram (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>).
The magnets are placed at the end of each belt, and within it.
The attracted mineral is held to its own belt, whilst the remainder
drops on to the next; the attracted mineral falls
into a bin as soon as its belt carries it out of the magnetic
field. The sand to be cleaned is fed on to the first belt by
means of a hopper.</p>

<p>The almost pure monazite so obtained is now treated
chemically for its thorium. The processes proposed and in
use are described in <a href="#Page275">Chapter XVIII</a>.</p>

<p>As already stated, the extraction of monazite in the
United States has practically ceased; but the processes
outlined above, which were first brought into use in the Carolinas,
have been adopted for the treatment of the Brazilian
sands.</p>

<h5 class="inline">(<i>b</i>) <b>The Idaho Deposits.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Monazite was first observed in
placer-gold deposits in the vicinity of Boise city near the
Snake river. This deposit was a gold-bearing sand derived
from granite. Later the gold-bearing sands of Oregon were
also found to contain monazite; these sands are rich in zircon,
and contain platinum and allied metals as well as gold. The
sands of the Pacific slope are the so-called black sands, derived
from hornblende, and augite-granites, usually porphyritic,
which are much weathered at the surface. The soil is loose<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
and is largely composed of granite fragments; the rain and
streams constantly bring it down to the valleys, and continually
renew the deposits. The concentrates obtained by
washing are rich in well-crystallised zircon, with titanite and
garnet.</p>

<p>In 1906 a company was formed to extract monazite from
the black sand residues left after the extraction of gold. By
1909 they had erected plant and commenced operations at
Centerville, and proposed to work the poorer auriferous sands
for gold during the monazite washing. This, it was expected,
could be done by washing the sands in boxes lined with amalgamated
copper plates, which would retain the gold. Considerable
amounts of monazite had already been extracted
from the tailings when a disastrous fire put a stop to the
operations in 1910.</p>

<p>Since then the production of monazite in the United States
has practically ceased.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Brazilian Deposits</span></h4>

<p>Brazil first became a serious competitor in the world’s
market with the United States, for the supply of monazite,
in 1895. The greater percentage of thorium, the more even
quality of the sands, and above all the occurrence on the sea-coast,
rendered the Brazilian monazite cheaper from the
beginning, so that it soon ousted the Carolina sand, and since
1910 has supplied the whole demand. The deposits at present
worked lie along the coasts of Bahia, Minas Geraes and Espirito
Santo, and whilst they are very rich in monazite, there is
the disadvantage that their position and extent, and so also
the possibility of working them, depend very largely on the
variations in the tides, etc. The largest of these deposits is
on the shores of a bay near the island of Alcobaca, on the
southern coast of Bahia.</p>

<p>Monazite also occurs to a considerable extent in the diamond
sands and gold-bearing sands of many of the interior provinces.
In Minas Geraes it has long been known to occur at the celebrated
mining centres of Diamantina and Ouro Preto, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
xenotime and other rare earth minerals are also found; it is
also known at various localities in the surrounding mining
provinces of São Paulo, Goyaz, and Matto Grosso. More
recently, extensive inland deposits have been found by Freise,
in the province of Espirito Santo.<a id="FNanchor122"></a><a href="#Footnote122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In the plateau-basin of
the Muriahé and Pomba rivers he found a sand known locally
as ‘catalco’ which carries an average of 2·1 per cent. of monazite
and a gold-content of 1·75 grams per ton. In the Aymoré’s
mountains he found monazite, both massive and granular,
in pegmatite veins in granite; analysis showed a thoria content
of 9·23 per cent., which is very high. These deposits would
form a very valuable and extensive source of thoria, if the
difficulties of transport could be overcome.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>At present, as stated above, only the beach deposits are
worked. The Brazilian Government has laid a very heavy
tax on all monazite exported; it is stated<a id="FNanchor123"></a><a href="#Footnote123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> that the German
Thorium Syndicate pays 50 per cent. of its profits in royalties
to the Government. In spite of this, the high quality of the
sand and the low cost of transport have enabled this combine
to lower the price of thorium nitrate to a point at which the
Carolina sands cannot be worked, and it appears probable
that the world’s markets will be supplied for some time, at
least, entirely from Brazil. The methods employed in working
the sand are similar to those already described.</p>

<p>In the last few years monazite deposits have been found
in various places, notably in Australia, India, and Ceylon.
In the latter locality it occurs sparingly in the gem-gravels,
in association with the much more valuable thorianite and
thorite, but the supply is uncertain, and the minerals cannot
be worked regularly. In Australia it occurs in Victoria and
in Queensland. In Victoria the deposits are poor in monazite&mdash;about
0·025 per cent.&mdash;so that working is not profitable.
In Queensland it occurs in beach sands on the southern coast,
with gold, platinum, and cassiterite; there seems to be no
reason why these deposits should not be profitably worked
when sufficient labour is forthcoming. It also occurs in North<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
Queensland, on the Walsh and Tinaroo mineral fields; here
it is found massive and granular in veins in granite, associated
with wolframite, molybdenite, and cassiterite.</p>

<p>Quite recently, deposits of considerable extent have been
found near Travancore, India.<a id="FNanchor124"></a><a href="#Footnote124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> These sands contain about
46 per cent. of the mineral, which is itself very rich in thoria,
containing about 10 per cent. of the oxide; the unconcentrated
sand is therefore as valuable as a source of thorium
nitrate as the ordinary Brazilian concentrates, which average
4 per cent. or less of the oxide.</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />
RADIOACTIVITY OF THE MINERALS</h3>

<p>In the present chapter no attempt will be made to give
a complete account of all the phenomena of radioactivity
which have been observed in the mineral world. There are,
however, a few problems of the highest scientific interest
which centre about the rare earth minerals, and mention of
these can hardly be avoided in a work which professes to give
a general account of the rare earth group. It is obvious that
a detailed treatment cannot be given without entering into
phenomena which would be quite beyond the range of the
present work, and an excuse is hardly needed, therefore, for
the fragmentary and abbreviated account which follows. The
reader’s acquaintance with the general phenomena of radioactivity
is of necessity assumed.</p>

<p>Radioactivity (the spontaneous emission of special
radiations) was first observed by Becquerel, in 1896, in the
case of potassium uranyl sulphate, and was soon found to be
common to all uranium compounds, and to the metal itself.
Mme. Curie showed that whilst in uranium salts the degree
of activity varies directly with the percentage of uranium,
in minerals containing the element the same rule does not hold.
The observation that pitchblende is considerably more
active than the uranium it contains led to the discovery of
polonium<a id="FNanchor125"></a><a href="#Footnote125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and radium in 1898. Exactly analogous phenomena
were shown to hold for thorium salts and thorium-containing
minerals by Mme. Curie and Schmidt in 1898,
and in 1905 Hahn separated Radio-thorium from thorianite.<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
In 1899 Debierne discovered that the rare earths precipitated
from the solution obtained on treatment of pitchblende are
associated with another extremely active body, which he
named Actinium; Giesel found that in the separation of the
rare earths this remains with lanthanum. In 1903 Ramsay
and Soddy experimentally confirmed the prediction of Rutherford
and Soddy, that radium would be found to produce
helium continuously. The discovery of these remarkable
phenomena has modified many fundamental physical conceptions,
and has opened up a new field of scientific enquiry,
which is being developed with unexampled rapidity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote125"><a href="#FNanchor125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a>
Polonium, which was named by Mme. Curie in honour of her native
country, has been shown to be identical with Marckwald’s ‘Radio-tellurium,’
which was named by Rutherford ‘Radium F’; it is one of the degradation
products of radium.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It has been mentioned, in the accounts of the rare earth
minerals given above, that almost all these minerals are radioactive,
<i>i.e.</i> have the property of emitting specific radiations.
Moreover, radioactivity, to any considerable extent at least,
is, with a few important exceptions, confined to the minerals
which have been already described. It has been shown by
many investigators, chief amongst whom are Strutt and
Boltwood, that the activity is usually due to the presence of
uranium or thorium, or both.<a id="FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote126"><a href="#FNanchor126"><span class="label">[126]</span></a>
Hauser and Wirth (<i>Ber.</i> 1910, <b>43</b>, 1807) observed activity in some zirconium
minerals containing neither thorium nor uranium.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>After the discovery of helium in Cleveite (a variety of
pitchblende, <i>vide</i> <a href="#Page13">p. 13</a>) in 1895 by Ramsay, a large number of
minerals were examined for this gas, and it was found that
almost all the rare earth minerals contain helium. The fact
that these minerals are also for the most part radioactive,
naturally suggested some relation between the activity and
the presence of helium, and led directly to the discovery that
radium is continuously producing helium; and it became
apparent that helium has been accumulating in these minerals
since their formation, by the decay of radioactive elements.
The question of the origin of helium in minerals will be touched
on <a href="#Ref62">again</a>.</p>

<p>In 1904 Boltwood advanced the theory that radium is
produced by the degradation of uranium, the parent-element
having, however, a much greater half-life period. If uranium
continuously produces radium, whilst the latter decays much<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
more rapidly than the former, it must follow that in minerals
containing uranium a state of equilibrium is reached between
uranium and radium, and the ratio of these two in all minerals
should therefore be constant, and independent of the geological
age. Boltwood examined a number of the minerals of which
descriptions have been given in the preceding chapters, and
found the ratio to be surprisingly constant.<a id="FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Strutt also
examined a large number of minerals,<a id="FNanchor128"></a><a href="#Footnote128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and whilst on the
whole his results seemed to support the theory, his values
for the ratio were by no means so constant as those of Boltwood.
Strutt included in his examination the interesting
radium-containing mineral observed by Danne at Issy
l’Evêque.<a id="FNanchor129"></a><a href="#Footnote129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This was a pyromorphite (lead chlorophosphate)
containing neither uranium nor thorium. Danne suggested
that the radium was not an original constituent, but had been
introduced by the action of percolating waters. This view
was confirmed by McCoy and Ross,<a id="FNanchor130"></a><a href="#Footnote130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> who found that the
activity was entirely confined to the surface layer.</p>

<p>Mlle. Gleditsch has also examined the question of the
uranium-radium ratio in minerals. Her earlier work<a id="FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> gave
ratios which, whilst constant for each mineral species, varied
in much the same manner as Strutt’s for different species,
and afforded very little support to Boltwood’s theory. Her
more recent results,<a id="FNanchor132"></a><a href="#Footnote132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> however, are much more closely in accord
with the theory, which has been still further strengthened by
the work of Pirret and Soddy<a id="FNanchor133"></a><a href="#Footnote133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
and of Marckwald and Russell.<a id="FNanchor134"></a><a href="#Footnote134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
It may now be regarded as firmly established that radium is
in the line of direct descent from uranium.</p>

<p id="Ref62">Boltwood had assumed that the helium in radioactive
minerals is produced from the uranium, during its disintegration.
Strutt, however, disputed this; his experiments showed
that very little helium is found even in the richest radium-uranium<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
minerals unless thorium is also present. Thus pitchblende
contains a very high percentage of uranium, but relatively
little helium (there is usually a considerable thorium
percentage here too, so that nothing conclusive can be deduced
from this). Adams<a id="FNanchor135"></a><a href="#Footnote135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> found that carnotite, a mineral very rich
in uranium, but containing no thorium, contains no helium
at all; he explained its absence by the very loose texture and
permeability of the mineral, which would allow the gas to
escape. Strutt concluded that whilst helium is undoubtedly
produced by disintegration in the uranium series, in minerals
it is produced more by thorium or, as more recent work
indicates, by radio-thorium, than by uranium.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The question of the origin of helium in minerals is, however,
not definitely settled, for several anomalous cases are known.
Thus the yttria silicate, <a href="#Ref63">Thalénite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), contains quantities
of helium, but no uranium or thorium is given in the analyses.
Similarly, Risörite contains a relatively large quantity of
helium, but only traces of uranium and thorium. In the last
mineral, the active constituent is precipitated with the lead,
so that no radio-thorium appears to be present. Further,
Thomsen analysed a fluorspar from Ivitgut in Greenland
which he found to contain 27 c.c. of helium per kilogram.
This specimen contains no uranium, but gives off the thorium
emanation in quantities which suggest the presence of radio-thorium;
moderate quantities of thorium are also present.
Since the α particle has been definitely identified as a positively
charged helium atom, it appears certain that disintegration in
all three series (uranium, actinium, and thorium series) produces
helium, and a mineral containing a member of any of
these series (which gives α rays or α ray-giving products)
would also contain helium.</p>

<p>Even so, there is a case in which the helium content is
anomalous, if not altogether beyond explanation at the present
stage. In examining a large number of minerals for helium,
Strutt<a id="FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> found that some samples of beryl, a beryllium
aluminium silicate, contain a relatively very large amount
of helium, but only traces of thorium, and was altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
inactive. The absence of any active constituent renders
untenable the ordinary explanations of the presence of such a
surprising quantity of helium. Boltwood has put forward a
suggestion which in the present state of our knowledge must
be regarded as a provisional explanation. He conceives that
in the concentration of beryllium from the parent magma, it
may have become associated with some short-lived intermediate
radioactive element, which had been altogether separated
from its long-lived parent element in the process of concentration;
this intermediate element, having collected in the
crystallised beryl, decayed completely in the course of the
great period which must have elapsed, leaving the helium to
which it had given rise during its disintegration enclosed in
the mineral. It is difficult to see how two substances which
must be so intimately connected as a parent-element and its
product could be completely separated in the process of cooling
of a magma; but since so little is known of the process of
crystallisation of minerals, the suggestion can hardly be
rejected on geological grounds. In any case, we have here
only one strongly marked exception to the very definite rule
that in all cases in which helium occurs in minerals, it is accompanied
by and undoubtedly produced from, a radioactive
element or elements; and in the majority of cases, the helium
in minerals is produced by disintegration of uranium or thorium
and their products.</p>

<p>Strutt found that traces of helium are universal in the
mineral world. His method of determining helium was
approximate only. He obtained the gas content by heating
the powdered mineral&mdash;a method which, as Wood has shown,<a id="FNanchor137"></a><a href="#Footnote137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
will only give all the gas when very high temperatures (up to
1000°C.) are employed. The gases were freed from oxygen
and hydrogen by passing over a heated, partially oxidised,
copper spiral, and from carbon dioxide by means of potash.
Nitrogen was removed by sparking with excess of oxygen
and shaking over potash; the excess of oxygen was removed
by melted phosphorus. The inert gases so obtained were
freed from all impurities by the use of the liquid alloy of sodium<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
and potassium for the electrodes of the spectrum tube in
which the gases were examined spectroscopically.<a id="FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Argon, if
present&mdash;it seems to be a universal constituent of igneous
rocks, into which it may have been absorbed from the air&mdash;was
removed by charcoal at a temperature of -80°C. The
helium so left was examined spectroscopically, and measured
in a MacLeod gauge.</p>

<p id="Footnote138"><a href="#FNanchor138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a>
As soon as the discharge is started in such a tube, all the gases present
other than those of the helium family are absorbed by these electrodes.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As stated, helium was found in traces in nearly all minerals,
and its presence is to be attributed to traces of radium, which
also appears universal. In minerals containing uranium or
thorium, or rare earths (the latter are almost always accompanied
by uranium and thorium), helium is found to a much
greater extent, and Ramsay considers it possible that some
fraction of the helium content may arise from the rare earth
metals. There is, however, no positive evidence to support
the conjecture. He found that the helium ratio, <i>i.e.</i> the
volume of helium per gram of uranous oxide, UO₂, varies with
the amount of thoria present; but where the latter is absent
the variations are much less marked. If helium were produced
in a mineral from uranium alone, and none escaped,
it is obvious that the helium ratio would depend only on the
age of the mineral. For minerals of about the same age, and
containing no thorium, the helium ratio would be roughly
constant, if no disturbing factor required consideration.</p>

<p>In 1905 Strutt pointed out that in all the minerals he
had examined, thorium was never present unless accompanied
by uranium and radium, whilst uranium and radium often
occurred without thorium. He suggested that the present
atomic weight of thorium, 232·5, was too low, and that it was
really the parent of uranium (at. weight 238·5); he further
supposed that the next permanent member in the line of
descent was one of the cerium metals. These suggestions
have been negatived by later work of Boltwood and Holmes.
The former pointed out<a id="FNanchor139"></a><a href="#Footnote139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> that it was far more likely that
thorium is a disintegration product of uranium of considerably<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
longer life. On the whole, however, there is very little positive
evidence to connect thorium with uranium.</p>

<p>In the same year Boltwood (<i>loc. cit.</i>) drew attention to
the persistent appearance of traces of lead, bismuth, barium,
etc., in the radioactive minerals, and also pointed out that
the variations of the ratio of helium to uranium in pitchblende
might be used to determine the age of the mineral. In 1907
he suggested<a id="FNanchor140"></a><a href="#Footnote140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> that lead was the final product of the degradation
of uranium, from which it follows that the ratio of uranium
to lead should be constant for minerals of the same age (since,
lead decays, if at all, at an infinitely slower rate than uranium).
He collected all the available analyses, and classified the
minerals dealt with into six groups according to the value of
the ratio. The order given by the ratio was declared to be in
accordance with the order of age as given by geological evidence.</p>

<p>Holmes<a id="FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> has further extended this work. He examined a
number of rare earth and allied minerals from the Christiania
district, which Brögger considers to be of approximately
Lower Devonian age, and found the ratio of lead to uranium
to approximate quite closely, for almost all the minerals examined,
to 0·045. Representing the change in the usual way as</p>

<p class="noindent">and using the data calculated by Rutherford and others for
the rates of decay, he gives the age of Lower Devonian strata
as about 370 million years. This figure is about twice as
great as that deduced by palæontologists from the flora and
fauna, and greater still than the times based on physical data,
<i>e.g.</i> rates of cooling, precession and nutation, etc. His figures
for pre-Cambrian rocks, based on the same ratio, range between
1000 and 1640 million years, the later being deduced from a
thorianite from the Archæan rocks of Ceylon. Strutt’s figure
for Archæan rocks is about 700 million years; this was derived
from work on the helium ratio, which must now be considered.<a id="FNanchor142"></a><a href="#Footnote142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>In 1898 Travers<a id="FNanchor143"></a><a href="#Footnote143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> had examined the effect of heat on cleveite
and fergusonite, and found that about half the total helium,
together with hydrogen, is given off at a bright red heat. He
considered it likely that the helium was combined with a metal
(though he recognised no distinction between occlusion and
combination) and remarked: ‘The results of such experiments
cannot therefore serve as a basis for speculation as to the
origin or history of the substances in question.’ The chemical
inactivity of helium, however, as well as the experiments of
Moss and Gray, who showed that helium was evolved on
grinding the materials,<a id="FNanchor144"></a><a href="#Footnote144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> indicate that the gas is mechanically
bound only. This, however, introduces the difficulty, if
an attempt be made to use the helium-uranium ratio
to calculate the age of minerals, that the gas would be
expected to escape from a porous material, so that its
amount is never so great as it should be. Strutt himself
found that helium escapes rapidly from powdered monazite,
whilst even the solid mineral was found to evolve helium
at a rate much in excess of the probable rate of production
by radioactive changes. Similar results were found
with thorianite, and the only conclusion, since helium is found
in the minerals, is that under the conditions under which
these minerals exist in the earth’s crust, this escape is checked
or altogether prevented. It follows, however, that any age
determined from the helium ratio must be a minimum age,
since there is always the chance of loss; this of course is not
the case&mdash;except where the minerals have suffered chemical
changes&mdash;with the lead ratio, and may account for the discrepancies
observed.</p>

<p>Strutt’s earlier work on the helium ratio was made with
phosphate minerals (coprolites and fossil bones) of known ages.
The ratios found were not in order of age, the minerals being
very permeable, so that helium had probably been lost. He
next turned his attention to igneous rocks, and selected zircon
for the work. Here he obtained some sort of regularity in
the order of age and the order given by the ratio, and assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
that if helium were lost at all, it must be lost in roughly proportional
amounts by reason of the similarity in conditions.
Geological criticism tends to lessen the trustworthiness of the
conclusions; it is pointed out that the age of a specimen of
zircon is not necessarily that of the rock in which it occurs,
for zircon is an extremely stable mineral, and might survive
unchanged several fusions and re-crystallisations of the magma.
Strutt replies to this that at the temperature of fusion of a
rock, zircon would certainly give up its accumulated helium,
so that the age determined from the helium content would be
that of the last fusion, <i>i.e.</i> the age as given by geological data.
On the other hand, our ignorance of the real mechanism of the
crystallisation of a magma, and especially of the amount and
effect of the pressures obtaining, robs this reply of its force,
and the objection must be counted valid.</p>

<p>In still later work Strutt used sphene and thorianite, and
his results agree as well as can be expected. The sphenes
used were all from Archæan rocks, except one, which was from
a Tertiary volcanic deposit of the Laacher See, near Coblenz
(the lake is in the crater of an extinct volcano). In this case
the helium ratio was very much smaller (about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4000</sub> of the
values for Archæan rocks) indicating the (comparatively)
extremely recent formation of the deposit.</p>

<p>The most recent results in the study of radioactivity
point to the conclusion that elements which differ in atomic
weight and radioactive properties may be chemically identical,
or at least chemically inseparable; such elements have been
termed isotopes. The end product of the thorium series of
radio-elements should have an atomic weight of about 208·4,
and it has been suggested that the element actually produced
in this series of changes may be bismuth. The latest results,
however, rather point to the conclusion that disintegration in the
thorium series gives rise to an isotope of lead. If this hypothesis
be true, the lead derived from a mineral rich in thorium and
poor in uranium should have an atomic weight appreciably
higher than that of ordinary lead. Experiments to test this
conclusion have recently been carried out by Soddy and Hyman.<a id="FNanchor145"></a><a href="#Footnote145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>These authors have made analyses of Ceylon thorite, which
they find to contain 0·35 per cent. of lead; from the ratio of
thorium to uranium in the mineral, they calculate that the
lead should have an atomic weight of 208·2, that of ordinary
lead being 207·1. Preliminary comparative experiments on
1 gram of pure lead chloride extracted from the mineral point
to an atomic weight for the thorite lead of 208·4, a result
surprisingly in accord with theory. More extended experiments
on this most interesting question are in progress.</p>

<p>The present chapter would be incomplete without a reference
to the interesting work of Goldsmidt on radioactivity as an
aid in identifying mineral species.<a id="FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> He describes a simple
method by which the activity of a mineral may be rapidly
and easily measured to a sufficient degree of approximation,
and shows how the determination enables a line to be drawn
on a diagram already mapped out; this line will intersect an
area on the diagram which corresponds to the particular
mineral. Owing to lack of analytical data, and to the great
difficulty of determining with accuracy small quantities of
uranium and thorium, the method is at present of scientific
interest only; but it is capable of development, and its development
would be of undoubted value in the further study of this
branch of radioactivity.</p>

<p>In order to make this part of the subject as clear as
possible, the chief points in this chapter are summarised
as follows:</p>

<p>1. Radioactivity is only observed to an appreciable extent
in some rather rare minerals. These minerals as a rule contain
radium, uranium, thorium, rare earths, and helium.</p>

<p>2. The helium has been produced during geological time
by the degradation of one or more members of the three series
of active elements (the Uranium, Actinium, and Thorium
series).</p>

<p>3. Radium is a degradation product of uranium, and itself
is degraded continuously; the final product of degradation is
probably lead.</p>

<p>4. The age of minerals has been calculated from the ratio<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
of lead to uranium; the figures obtained are much greater
than those put forward by geologists and physicists.</p>

<p>5. The helium ratio has also been used, but appears less
trustworthy, owing to escape of helium, and uncertainty as
to geological age of the minerals employed.</p>

<p>6. Some connection between radioactivity and the presence
of the yttrium or cerium metals appears highly probable, but
no satisfactory theories have been advanced on this point;
it has been shown that actinium is very closely allied to
lanthanum.</p>

<h2><span class="topline">PART II</span><br />
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE ELEMENTS</h2>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE CERIUM AND
YTTRIUM GROUPS</h3>

<p>The chemistry of the rare earth elements begins in the
year 1794, with Gadolin’s discovery of the new oxide ‘Ytterbia,’
for which the name Yttria was subsequently proposed by
Ekeberg, and generally adopted (see <a href="#Page1">Chapter I</a>, and under
<a href="#Ref2">Gadolinite</a>, p. 35). The discovery of Ceria followed in 1804
(see under <a href="#Ref1">Cerite</a>, p. 32). The classical work of Mosander,
carried out between 1838 and 1842, showed the complex
nature of the new oxides. From ceria he separated three new
earths, Ceria proper, Lanthana, and Didymia. Yttria was
shown to be a mixture of at least three oxides, for which the
names Yttria, Erbia, and Terbia were proposed. These oxides
were believed to have the general formula RO, by analogy
with the alkaline earths, which they were found to resemble
in many respects, notably in their strongly basic character.</p>

<p>The properties of the new oxides were examined during
the next twenty years by many chemists, the chief workers
being Marignac, Rammelsberg, and Hermann, but the next
important advance was the investigation of the absorption
spectra of solutions of the rare earth salts, first suggested by
Gladstone in 1856, and developed more fully by Bunsen and
Kirchhoff in 1860 and the following few years. The introduction
of the methods of spectrum analysis furnished a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
delicate and valuable method of examining and identifying
the various oxides, and so greatly assisted the laborious processes
of separation.</p>

<p>Sixteen elements (excluding thorium and zirconium) are
at the present time recognised as belonging to the rare earth
group. With one or two exceptions, these show the closest
resemblance to one another, both in chemical behaviour and
in the properties of their compounds, so that the difficulties
of separating and purifying them are very great. They may
be said to form a series, in which the properties vary continuously
but gradually from member to member, so that no
sharp differences are anywhere perceptible. The method of
division into groups is, therefore, almost entirely one of
convenience, and has arisen from the course which the
separations have followed.</p>

<p>The elements are divided into two chief families or groups,
that of the cerium metals and that of the yttrium metals
respectively. The cerium elements are separated by a process
depending on the relative insolubility of their alkali double
sulphates; in this group are included cerium, lanthanum,
praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium. The yttrium
family is further divided into four sub-groups: the first
consists of scandium and yttrium; the second or terbium
group of europium, gadolinium, and terbium; the third or
erbium group of dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium;
and the fourth or ytterbium group of ytterbium and lutecium&mdash;the
element celtium, recently discovered by Urbain,
will also fall into this sub-group, but the discovery awaits
confirmation. Whilst scandium and yttrium fall into somewhat
abnormal positions, corresponding to their low atomic
weights, the terbium elements occupy an intermediate position
between the cerium elements and the remaining yttrium
elements, or yttrium group proper, and so are frequently
classified as a third or intermediate group.</p>

<p>This list does not include all the names which have been
put forward to designate what have been claimed from time
to time as new elements; whilst the individuality of some of
those included is not yet fully established, and the homogeneity<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
of others has been called in question. The uncertainty is
more pronounced among the yttrium elements than among
the cerium elements; owing to the opportunities for investigation
furnished by the commercial treatment of monazite, the
chemistry of the cerium group may be regarded as complete.</p>

<p>In the following table the elements are arranged in order
of increasing atomic weight, and it can be seen at once how
closely the division into groups follows this order:</p>

<p>In their chemical relations, the rare earth elements may
be placed between the metals of the alkaline earths, and the
trivalent metals iron, aluminium, and chromium. With the
exceptions of cerium in the ceric salts, and of samarium and
europium in the recently discovered dichlorides, they are
uniformly trivalent, but the oxides are very strong bases,
and the salts very slightly hydrolysed in dilute solutions;
generally, therefore, they resemble the calcium family rather
than the aluminium group. Among the common salts, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
oxalates, phosphates, chromates, iodates, fluorides, carbonates,
tartrates, and borates are almost insoluble; the sulphates are
only sparingly soluble at ordinary temperatures. Among the
double salts, the alkali double sulphates are of great importance
from their employment for separations; the tendency to the
formation of complex salts is greater among the yttrium than
among the cerium elements, increasing with the atomic weight,
and with the decrease in basic strength of the oxides.</p>

<p>The great similarity in chemical behaviour of the rare
earth elements is apparent not only in the similarity in composition,
solubility and chemical properties of the salts&mdash;which
is so great that the general account of the compounds
which follows applies almost in its entirety to each member of
the group&mdash;but also in the crystallographic relations between
corresponding compounds. Many of the salt hydrates form
isomorphous series; the sulphate octohydrates, for example,
appear to be isomorphous throughout the whole group, and
probably the relation would be found to apply even more
completely than is generally accepted, if the necessary data were
forthcoming. Of great interest and practical importance is the
isomorphism between the nitrates and double nitrates of the
cerium elements and bismuth, which has been utilised with such
valuable results in the processes of fractional crystallisation.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The Metals.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The earlier attempts to reduce compounds
of the rare earth elements to the metallic condition, by means
of metallic sodium or potassium, did not yield pure products;
nor did the use of aluminium or magnesium lead to results of
practical importance. The metals were first obtained in a
coherent physical condition by Hillebrand and Norton,<a id="FNanchor147"></a><a href="#Footnote147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> by
electrolysis of the fused chlorides. These investigators obtained
cerium, lanthanum, and the so-called didymium, and
measured their specific heats; their results confirmed the
atomic weights assigned to the elements by Mendelejeff,
except in the case of lanthanum. Their method has since
been elaborated by Muthmann, Hofer and Weiss,<a id="FNanchor148"></a><a href="#Footnote148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
prepared large quantities of the cerium elements in the pure
state. More recently, Hirsch has prepared metallic cerium
in large quantities,<a id="FNanchor149"></a><a href="#Footnote149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and has studied its properties.</p>

<p>In consequence of the high values of the heats of combustion,
the metals have powerful reducing properties.</p>

<p>The cerium metals form alloys with magnesium, zinc,
aluminium, and iron, and combine with boron and silicon.
The alloys of cerium, and the metal itself, are remarkable for
their property of emitting brilliant sparks when scratched (see
<a href="#Page313">Chapter XXI</a>). Cerium also forms an amalgam with mercury.</p>

<p>The metals burn brilliantly when heated in oxygen, and
dissolve readily in dilute mineral acids. When heated to a
temperature of 200°-300° in a current of hydrogen, they
absorb the gas very readily, forming the <i>hydrides</i>. These
compounds are also obtained by heating the oxides with
magnesium in a current of hydrogen. They were first prepared
by Winkler,<a id="FNanchor152"></a><a href="#Footnote152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> who deduced from his analyses the general formula
RH₂; the more recent work of Muthmann and Beck,<a id="FNanchor153"></a><a href="#Footnote153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> however,

gelatinous precipitates on the addition of alkalies to hot dilute
solutions of the salts; precipitation in the cold, or in strong
solution, usually gives a basic salt, or an hydroxide mixed
with a large quantity of basic salt. The hydroxides are
insoluble in excess of precipitant, but the precipitation is

<h5 class="inline"><b>Oxides.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;In their most stable state of oxidation, the
rare earth elements are generally trivalent. In the case of
cerium, the dioxide, CeO₂, is more stable than the sesquioxide
Ce₂O₃, but the ceric salts are unstable, and are very readily
reduced to cerous compounds, corresponding to the oxide
Ce₂O₃. Higher oxides are known with certainty among the
other elements only in the cases of praseodymium and terbium,
but these do not give rise to salts.</p>

<p>The oxides R₂O₃ are fairly strong bases, being comparable
in strength to the alkaline earths, and far more strongly basic
than alumina and oxides of other trivalent elements; thus
they liberate ammonia from ammonium compounds, whilst
the salts they form with strong acids are not easily hydrolysed.
Their relative strengths as bases are expressed in the following
series, in which the elements are placed in order of diminishing
electropositive character:<a id="FNanchor158"></a><a href="#Footnote158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote158"><a href="#FNanchor158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a>
The position of yttrium in this series is not known with certainty; it
is probably as positive as neodymium. It is usually stated (see Meyer and
Hauser, pp. 32-33) that the terbia oxides are intermediate in basic strength
between the ceria and yttria earths, though the arrangement into two series,
consisting of the cerium and yttrium groups respectively, is generally adopted;
the electropositive character of the elements in each series then weakens as
the atomic weight rises, scandium being of course exceptional.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It will be seen that, with the exception of scandium and yttrium,
the metals of the cerium and yttrium groups become less
electropositive as the atomic weight increases.</p>

<p>This arrangement is obtained by ascertaining the order in<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
which the various hydroxides are precipitated from a solution
by gradual addition of a dilute solution of a strong base. The
weakest base is precipitated first, and the strongest last;
those intermediate in strength are thrown down in ascending
order of strength. Similar results may be obtained by the
fractional decomposition of the nitrates by heat; in this case
the nitrate of the weakest base is decomposed at the lowest
temperature. This order is also confirmed, as far as the data
are available, by measurements of the equivalent conductivities
of solutions of the salts (see, for example, <a href="#Page122">p. 122</a>).</p>

<p>Quite recently, a very different order has been obtained
from a consideration of the dissociation tensions, and of the
heats of dissociation of the anhydrous sulphates.<a id="FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> In the
following table the elements are arranged in the order of the
increase of the dissociation tension (T) measured at 900°,
which is the same as the order of decrease of the heats of
dissociation (Q):</p>

<p>It will be observed that the order is very different from the
order of increase of atomic weight, the positions of lutecium
and ytterbium being especially surprising; these elements are
generally considered to be among the least electropositive of
the whole series. The anomalous position of cerium is probably
due to the fact that the sulphate on decomposition leaves the<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
dioxide, and not the sesquioxide, as with the other elements;
this would undoubtedly affect the values. The heats of dissociation
are the greatest yet observed for the sulphates of
trivalent metals, a further evidence of the strongly basic
nature of the oxides.</p>

<p>Ignited lanthana resembles quicklime in that it readily
absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, and hisses when slaked
with water; as the basicity becomes weaker, the affinity for
water and carbon dioxide becomes less marked. All the
oxides are soluble in dilute acids, even after prolonged ignition;
but the ease with which solution occurs is naturally much
influenced by the treatment to which the oxide has been
subjected, as well as by its strength as a base.</p>

<p>The rare earth oxides are capable of existing in more than
one modification, the compounds obtained by ignition of
the hydroxides differing in appearance and reactivity from
those prepared by ignition of the oxalates or nitrates, and so
on; they are probably highly polymerised. Cerium dioxide,
CeO₂, is remarkable for its power of combining with the other
oxides, R₂O₃, of the rare earth metals. The pure dioxide is
insoluble in nitric acid, but mixtures of earths containing up
to 50 per cent. of the dioxide dissolve readily. The various
colours of mixtures of the ceria earths may sometimes be
attributed to a similar combination,<a id="FNanchor160"></a><a href="#Footnote160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and there can be little
doubt that the dioxide sometimes functions as an acid in the
rare earth minerals.</p>

In this behaviour, the rare earth elements resemble aluminium

<p>The normal sulphides, R₂S₃, are obtained by reduction of

carbide gives pure methane.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Halogen Salts.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The halides of the rare earth elements
show a close analogy with the corresponding compounds of the
alkaline earth elements. The <i>fluorides</i> are insoluble in water
and dilute mineral acids, and are obtained as gelatinous precipitates
by the addition of hydrofluoric acid, or a soluble
fluoride, to solutions of the salts. They may be prepared in
the crystalline condition by heating the carbides in a stream
of fluorine, or by the action of hydrofluoric acid upon the
hydroxides in aqueous suspension. The rare earth elements,
as well as thorium, may be separated from zirconium by
taking advantage of the insolubility of their fluorides in excess
of hydrofluoric acid or alkali fluorides, since zirconium fluoride<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
is readily soluble in excess of the precipitant. The solubility
of the fluorides in a large excess of concentrated acid increases
with the electropositive character of the metal, the fluorides
of the more negative elements being the least soluble. Thorium
and scandium may, therefore, be concentrated to a large
extent by repeated precipitation with hydrofluoric acid in
acid solution.</p>

<p>The <i>silicofluorides</i> of the rare earth elements have been
used by R. J. Meyer in the extraction of scandium from
wolframite (see <a href="#Page1">Chapter I</a> and <a href="#Ref64">under Scandium</a>, p. 215). They
are thrown down as gelatinous precipitates on addition of
potassium or sodium silicofluoride to boiling, neutral solutions
of rare earth salts. In presence of mineral acids, however,
they are not thrown down in the cold; on boiling, the cerium
metals are precipitated as fluorides, by hydrolysis of the
silicofluorides&mdash;the yttrium elements, with the exception of
scandium, being held in solution by the mineral acid.</p>

<p>With the exception of the fluorides, the halogen salts of
the rare earth metals are readily soluble in water, and crystallise
from the concentrated solutions in the hydrated form. The
bromides and iodides have not been so fully studied as the
chlorides; they are hygroscopic salts, and decompose rather
easily. The iodides have been obtained by Moissan in the
anhydrous state, by the action of iodine vapour on the carbides
at high temperature.</p>

<p>The anhydrous <i>chlorides</i> may be obtained by the application
of any of the ordinary methods, <i>e.g.</i> by heating the oxides
with carbon in a stream of chlorine, by heating the carbides in
the same gas, by heating the sulphides or hydrated chlorides
in hydrogen chloride, or by evaporating the solutions of the
hydrated salts to dryness in presence of ammonium chloride,
and then igniting till the latter has all been removed. As
obtained by any of these methods, they are fusible at a red
heat, but only slightly volatile; they are easily soluble in
water or alcohol, with disengagement of heat. They are
insoluble in most organic solvents, but dissolve to some extent
in some bases; the chlorides of the yttrium elements, for
example, are readily soluble in pyridine. With such solvents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
the chlorides form compounds which may be considered as
derived from the hydrated forms, by replacement of the so-called
water of crystallisation by the organic base.</p>

<p>Conductivity measurements show that the salts are not
perceptibly hydrolysed in moderately dilute aqueous solutions,
though the values for the equivalent conductivities vary
somewhat with the variations in the electropositive character of
the elements. In the following table, the equivalent conductivities
of the chlorides in solutions of dilution 32 and 1024 at
25°C. are given. It will be seen that the value (λ₁₀₂₄ - λ₃₂) ÷ 10
is in all cases (except for the highly hydrolysed scandium
salt) very close to 3, an experimental proof of the trivalent
nature of the elements. The values for the chlorides of iron,
aluminium and chromium are included; it will be seen that
these elements are considerably less positive than the rare
earth metals (with the exception, of course, of scandium).</p>

<p>From aqueous solutions the chlorides crystallise with six
molecules of water, except praseodymium chloride, which has
seven. The hydrated salts, when heated to 120° in the air,
form insoluble oxychlorides of the general formula ROCl.</p>

<p>The chlorides do not show a great tendency to form double
salts with other metallic chlorides; on the other hand, they
readily form complex compounds with the chlorides of the less
electropositive metals, e.g. tin, bismuth, gold, and platinum.</p>

<p>Subchlorides of samarium and europium have recently<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
been obtained; in these compounds, for the first time, rare
earth metals have been shown to be capable of functioning
as divalent elements.</p>

<p><i>Cyanides</i> of the rare earth elements are not known; addition
of potassium cyanide to solutions of the salts throws down the
hydroxides. The <i>platinocyanides</i> may be obtained by double
decomposition of the sulphates with barium platinocyanide.
They are very stable and characteristic bodies, of the general
formula R₂[Pt(CN)₄]₃, with 18 or 21 molecules of water. The
compounds of the cerium elements are yellow, with a strong
blue fluorescence; they crystallise in the monoclinic system.
The platinocyanides of the yttrium metals are red or crimson,
with a splendid green fluorescence, and crystallise in the
rhombic system. Scandium platinocyanide is of great interest
from the fact that it exists in two modifications, which show
the characteristic appearance of the two groups of compounds
respectively.</p>

excess. The ferrocyanides have been proposed for the purification
of yttrium; the method is useful where rapid concentration
of the element is required, yttrium ferrocyanide being
far more soluble than the analogous compounds of the erbium
and ytterbium metals, but the precipitates are gelatinous,
and very difficult to handle.</p>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;<i>Perchlorates</i> and <i>periodates</i> of the
rare earth elements, of the general formula R(XO₄)₃,<i>x</i>H₂O,
have been obtained. The existence of <i>chlorates</i> has been
observed only in the yttrium group; yttrium chlorate,
Yt(ClO₃)₃,8H₂O, has been prepared by double decomposition
of the sulphate with barium chlorate. The <i>bromates</i> are also
prepared in this way. They are readily soluble compounds,
of which several hydrated forms are known. They are of
considerable importance for purposes of separation in the
yttrium group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

<p>The <i>iodates</i> are sparingly soluble bodies, precipitated by
addition of the alkali compound to solutions of the rare earth
salts. The rare earth iodates are soluble in nitric acid, the
solubility increasing as the electropositive character of the
element becomes stronger. A method for the purification of
yttrium has recently been based upon this property of the
iodates, whilst the fact that thorium iodate is completely
insoluble in nitric acid allows of the easy separation and
estimation of thorium in minerals or mixtures containing rare
earth elements.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Sulphates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The sulphates of the rare earth elements are
obtained by dissolving the oxides or hydroxides in sulphuric
acid. From the solutions so obtained, various hydrated salts
separate according to the temperature of crystallisation. By
heating the hydrated salts to a temperature of 300°-400°,
the anhydrous salts are prepared. These are extremely
soluble in water at 0°, having a great tendency, which is
indeed to be observed in the hydrated forms also, to form supersaturated
solutions. When the temperature of such a solution
is allowed to rise, larger or smaller quantities of an hydrated
form separate out, the differences of solubility among the
sulphate hydrates of the various elements being sometimes
considerable.</p>

<p>The hydrated sulphates of the cerium elements have been
very closely studied in connection with the purification of
thorium. Cerium sulphate itself forms hydrates with 12, 9,
8, 5, and 4 molecules of water, but sulphates of the other
elements generally form fewer hydrates; the commonest
have 12, 8, or 4 molecules of water, and numerous cases of
isomorphism are known among them. The solubility curve
of the cerium sulphate hydrates is shown in the diagram.
<a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>. The sulphates of the yttrium elements have not
yet been systematically investigated, and in most cases only
the octohydrates are known. Scandium sulphate is notably
different from the other sulphates, in that it is considerably
more soluble, and crystallises with six molecules of water.</p>

<p>It is an important characteristic of the rare earth elements
that the solubility of the sulphates diminishes rapidly as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
temperature rises. The study of the various equilibrium
conditions is greatly complicated by the tendency to form
supersaturated solutions, and the fact that many hydrates
can exist throughout considerable ranges of temperature in<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
the metastable condition; in consequence of this, also, the
solubilities of many hydrates are known for temperatures
far beyond the transition points. Foreign elements may be
separated by taking advantage of the very great solubility of
the anhydrous sulphates at 0°, and the rapid decrease in
solubility with rise of temperature. For this purpose, a solution
of the anhydrous sulphates saturated at 0° is prepared,
and after filtration is slowly allowed to come to room temperature;
the hydrated rare earth sulphates then separate, leaving
in solution the foreign sulphates. This method may indeed
be used instead of the oxalate separation (see <a href="#Page147">p. 147</a>).</p>

<p>In presence of excess of sulphuric acid, <i>acid sulphates</i> of
the general formula R(HSO₄)₃ are formed. These are fairly
stable, and must be heated to a temperature of 400°-500° to
decompose them completely to the normal salts; even at that
temperature, traces of acid are tenaciously retained, a fact
which renders the determination of the equivalents by the
sulphate method unreliable, unless special precautions are
taken. On further heating, the normal sulphates pass into
<i>basic salts</i>, R₂O₃,SO₃, and finally, at the temperature of the
blowpipe flame, into the oxides. The temperatures at which
these decompositions occur vary with the positive character
of the elements; the most basic oxide clings most tenaciously
to sulphuric anhydride, and forms the most stable acid salt.
Lanthanum sulphate, for example, requires to be heated for
a considerable time at a white heat if the pure oxide is required,
whilst the sulphates of the less positive elements are easily
decomposed at a red heat. The order of basic strength of the
oxides, as determined by the ease with which the sulphates
are decomposed, seems, however, to be very different from the
order determined by decomposition of the nitrates (see <a href="#Page118">p. 118</a>).</p>

<p>With the alkali sulphates, the sulphates of the rare earth
elements readily form <i>double salts</i>, which are of great importance
in separation, on account of the great differences in
solubility. The double sulphates of the cerium group are
almost insoluble in excess of alkali sulphate, whereas the
yttrium double sulphates, with the exception of those of the
terbium metals, which occupy an intermediate position, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
very easily soluble. This method of separating the elements
into the two main groups was first employed by Berzelius,
and though a century has elapsed, it remains to-day the most
efficient method of effecting the separation.</p>

<p>The <i>ethylsulphates</i> have been employed by Urbain and
others in effecting separations, especially in the erbium and
terbium groups. The solubilities of these salts are in the same
general order as those of the alkali double sulphates, and they
are especially convenient for separating the metals into the
three groups of the cerium, terbium, and yttrium elements
respectively. They may be prepared by double decomposition
of the rare earth sulphates with barium ethylsulphate, but
on account of the ease with which the alkylsulphates are
hydrolysed by acids, it is essential that the solutions should
be quite neutral. A more convenient method, according
to James, is the treatment of the anhydrous chlorides in
alcohol solution with sodium ethylsulphate dissolved in
the same medium; sodium chloride is precipitated, whilst
the ethylsulphates of the rare earth elements remain in
solution.</p>

<p>The <i>sulphites</i> of the rare earth elements are sparingly
soluble crystalline salts, of the general formula R₂(SO₃)₃,<i>x</i>H₂O.
They are obtained by passing sulphur dioxide into a suspension
of the hydroxides in water, or by double decomposition of
soluble salts with alkali sulphite. They dissolve in excess of
sulphurous acid, and on evaporation of the solution are
deposited unchanged. They are distinguished from thorium
sulphite by the fact that they form no alkali double salts.
The strongly electropositive character of the rare earth metals
is shown by the fact that they form normal and not basic
sulphites.</p>

<p>The <i>thiosulphates</i> are readily soluble, crystalline bodies.
With the exception of the ceric and scandium salts, they are
not hydrolysed in boiling solution, a fact which allows of a
complete separation from the readily hydrolysed thiosulphates
of zirconium and thorium.</p>

<p><i>Dithionates</i> of the commoner rare earth elements, of the
general formula R₂(S₂O₆)₃,<i>x</i>H₂O, have been prepared by double<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
decomposition of the sulphates with barium dithionate. They
are readily soluble, crystalline salts.</p>

<p>The <i>selenates</i> are soluble, crystalline salts, which separate
from aqueous solutions in various hydrated forms. They
resemble the sulphates in being less soluble in hot than in
cold water, and numerous cases of isomorphism have been
observed among the corresponding sulphate and selenate
hydrates. Several alkali double selenates have been described;
they show a close resemblance to the analogous double sulphates.</p>

<p>The <i>selenites</i> are amorphous, insoluble compounds, obtained
by the action of selenious acid on the carbonates, or on solutions
of neutral salts. Basic and acid selenites are also known.</p>

<p class="clearboth">&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Nitrates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The nitrates are crystalline, deliquescent
compounds, readily soluble in water and alcohol, but less
easily in nitric acid, a fact which has been of considerable
importance for purposes of separation. The solubility is
greatest in the case of lanthanum nitrate, diminishing through
the cerium group to a minimum in gadolinium nitrate, and
then increasing again. They separate from aqueous solution
in the form of crystalline hydrates; in the cerium group,
these have commonly the formula R(NO₃)₃,6H₂O, whilst the
nitrates of the yttrium elements usually crystallise with 3
or 5 molecules of water. By carefully heating the hydrated
salts, basic nitrates may be obtained, which in the yttrium
group are soluble in water, and may be obtained crystalline;
in the cerium group, the basic nitrates are insoluble. By
further heating, insoluble ‘superbasic salts,’ and finally the
oxides, are obtained in all cases. The temperatures at which
these basic and superbasic compounds are formed vary with
the electropositive character of the element; this fact affords
a method of separation which has been very frequently
employed.</p>

<p>An interesting series of addition compounds of the rare
earth nitrates with antipyrine (dimethylphenylpyrazolone,
C₁₁H₁₂ON₂) has been described recently by Kolbe.<a id="FNanchor164"></a><a href="#Footnote164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Those of the
cerium metals have the general formula R(NO₃)₃,3C₁₁H₁₂ON₂;<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
the yttrium nitrates appear to combine with four molecules
of the base.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The tendency to form double nitrates with nitrates of the
metals of Group I<span class="smcapall">a</span> and Group II<span class="smcapall">a</span> also varies with the basic
strength of the hydroxides. In the most positive elements
of the cerium group, the tendency is very pronounced, and
there are a large number of stable, crystalline double salts;
but the stability decreases rapidly as the atomic weight of
the element rises, and in the terbium and yttrium groups
crystallised double nitrates cannot be obtained. The solubility
of these double salts increases rapidly in the same
direction, the lanthanum double nitrates being the least
soluble. For this reason, these compounds are of great importance
for the purpose of separation, especially in the cerium
group. Bismuth nitrate and the various bismuth double
nitrates are isomorphous with the corresponding compounds of
the cerium group, and the double bismuth ammonium and bismuth
magnesium salts have been largely used by Urbain in the
separation of samarium and the elements of the terbium group.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Phosphates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Addition of phosphoric acid, or an alkali
phosphate to solutions of rare earth salts throws down the
phosphates as gelatinous precipitates, which slowly become
crystalline on standing. The precipitate is soluble in excess
of phosphoric acid, and in other mineral acids, a fact of great
importance in the commercial treatment of monazite. The
composition of the precipitate is not known with certainty;
both neutral and acid phosphates can probably be obtained
according to the conditions. Double salts with the alkali
phosphates can be prepared by fusion methods. The naturally
occurring phosphates, monazite and xenotime, are mixtures
of the orthophosphates of the cerium and yttrium elements
respectively.</p>

<p><i>Phosphites</i> are known in a few cases only; <i>arsenates</i> and
<i>arsenites</i> of lanthanum have been prepared. <i>Vanadates</i> of
some of the rare earth elements have been described.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Chromates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The rare earth chromates are, as a rule,
sparingly soluble in water, and show considerable differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
of solubility amongst themselves; for this reason, they have
been of some use in the separation of the cerium elements.<a id="FNanchor165"></a><a href="#Footnote165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
They are obtained by addition of potassium chromate to
neutral solutions of rare earth salts as crystalline precipitates,
of the general formula R₂(CrO₄)₃,8H₂O; with a large excess
of alkali chromate, double chromates are obtained, which are
more readily formed, and more soluble, in the yttrium series
than in the cerium group. Addition of chromic acid or
alkali bichromate to solutions of the soluble salts gives no
precipitate, a fact which allows of the separation of zirconium
and thorium, and of cerium in the tetravalent state, since the
tetravalent elements are precipitated by both these reagents.</p>

<p>Ammonium molybdate throws down from neutral solution
of rare earth salts gelatinous precipitates of the <i>molybdates</i>;
the formula La₂2(HMoO₄)₆ is assigned to the lanthanum compound
obtained in this way. No precipitation occurs if the
solution be strongly acid; on this fact a process has recently
been based for the volumetric estimation of thorium, in presence
of rare earth salts, by means of ammonium molybdate (see
<a href="#Page289">p. 289</a>).</p>

<p>Various <i>silicotungstates</i> and <i>double tungstates</i> have been
described.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Carbonates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The more pronounced electropositive character
of the rare earth elements, as contrasted with other
trivalent metals, is well illustrated by the fact that they form
stable neutral carbonates of the formula R₂(CO₃)₃,<i>x</i>H₂O.
These may be obtained by passing a current of carbon dioxide
through an aqueous suspension of the hydroxides, or by
addition of an alkali carbonate to neutral solutions of the
salts. Basic carbonates are known in the case of the less
positive yttrium elements only; both these and the neutral
carbonates are insoluble in water.</p>

<p>In presence of a large excess of alkali carbonate, double
carbonates are formed. The stability as well as the solubility
of these compounds increases in passing from the cerium to<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
the yttrium group, <i>i.e.</i> as the electropositive character becomes
weaker. The double carbonates of the cerium elements are
sparingly soluble, and are decomposed by water, especially
on warming; they may, however, be recrystallised from alkali
carbonate solution. The sodium and ammonium double salts
are less soluble than the potassium compounds. The latter
have the general formula R₂(CO₃)₃,K₂CO₃,12H₂O, and are of
considerable importance in many processes of separation.
The yttrium elements can be separated from the cerium metals,
and the latter from one another, by taking advantage of the
differences of solubility shown by the potassium double
carbonates. If a concentrated solution of the salts in potassium
carbonate solution be fractionally diluted with water, the
cerium elements separate in the order: lanthanum, praseodymium,
cerium, neodymium, and samarium; the more
soluble yttrium compounds remain in the solution. Thorium
forms double alkali carbonates which are very readily soluble
in excess of alkali carbonate; this property is of great importance
for the technical separation of the element.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Oxalates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The oxalates of the rare earth elements are
of the greatest importance, on account of the fact that they
are not only insoluble in water, but are also very sparingly
soluble in dilute mineral acids, and in excess of oxalic acid.
They can be completely precipitated even from strongly acid
solutions by addition of sufficient excess of oxalic acid, or
alkali oxalate, and thus afford a means of easily and completely
separating the rare earth group from the commoner elements.</p>

<p>They are thrown down by addition of oxalic acid, or alkali
oxalate, as amorphous precipitates, which rapidly become
crystalline, especially if the solution is warmed. From water
at normal temperatures they usually separate as the decahydrates,
R₂(C₂O₄)₃,10H₂O, but hydrates with 7, 9, and
11 molecules of water of crystallisation are also known.
From strongly acid solutions, mixed oxalo-salts of the general
formula R(C₂O₄)X, where X = Cl, NO₃, HSO₄, etc., may be
obtained. These mixed salts may also be prepared by dissolving
the oxalates in concentrated solutions of the chlorides,
nitrates, etc., whilst nitro-sulphates, R(SO₄)NO₃, have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
obtained by recrystallising the sulphates from strong nitric

<p>The solubilities of the oxalates in mineral acids of various
concentrations have been examined by Hauser and Wirth.<a id="FNanchor167"></a><a href="#Footnote167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Whilst the solubilities in water are exceedingly slight, and
increase with increasing atomic weight of the elements, <i>i.e.</i>
from the cerium to the yttrium group, in mineral acids of
concentration 3-4N the solubility becomes noticeable, and
is greatest for the oxalates of the most positive elements.
The solubility is greatly lessened, however, if considerable
excess of oxalic acid be present.</p>

<p>Double oxalates with the alkali oxalates can be obtained
with the salts of the yttrium elements only, the oxalates of
the cerium elements being almost insoluble in excess of alkali
oxalate in the cold. Of the alkali double oxalates, the potassium
compounds are the most soluble, but the ammonium
compounds show the greatest differences in solubility; von
Welsbach has employed the method of fractional crystallisation
of these salts from a saturated solution of ammonium oxalate
for separations in the yttrium group. The sodium double
oxalates are the least soluble of these double salts.</p>

<p>Since the rare earth elements are almost always separated
in the form of the oxalates, the methods for transforming
these into soluble compounds become important. They may
be ignited to oxides, and these dissolved in nitric acid; if
the content of ceria is very high, the oxide mixture may become
insoluble, but this difficulty may be overcome by addition of
a reducing agent&mdash;hydrogen peroxide is very convenient for
this purpose. The oxalates may also be dissolved directly
in fuming nitric acid, care being taken to avoid loss; if the
mixture contains cerium, the oxidation is hastened, ceric
salts having the property of acting as oxygen carriers. By
boiling for a short time with potash, the oxalates may be
easily transformed into the hydroxides, which can be dissolved
in dilute acids.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Formates.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;On account of the considerable differences in
solubility by which they are characterised, these salts have
been employed for separations. The formates of the cerium
group are considerably less soluble than those of the yttrium
group. They may be partly precipitated from solutions of
rare earth salts by addition of alkali formate&mdash;formic acid
itself causes precipitation only with salts of weak acids, <i>e.g.</i>
the acetates&mdash;but are best prepared by dissolving the oxides
in formic acid; on concentration of the solution, the formates
of the cerium and terbium elements successively separate,
the salts of the yttrium group remaining in solution. The
separation of the terbium earths by this method was attempted
by Delafontaine; his ‘new’ element, Philippium, obtained
from the mother-liquors, was in reality a mixture of the terbium
and yttrium elements, which cannot be completely separated
by the formate method.<a id="FNanchor168"></a><a href="#Footnote168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The <i>acetates</i> are readily soluble in water, the yttrium salts
being rather less easily soluble than those of the cerium group.
They are therefore obtained by dissolving the oxides in acetic
acid; addition of alkali acetate to a solution of a rare earth
salt gives no precipitate, even on boiling, behaviour which is
in marked contrast to the ease with which the salts of other
trivalent metals are hydrolysed under these conditions. In
this respect the rare earth elements differ also from the tetravalent
elements zirconium and thorium (and from cerium in
the tetravalent state); soluble salts of the latter, on boiling
with sodium acetate, give insoluble basic acetates. Even
sparingly soluble compounds of the rare earth elements are
as a rule taken into solution by digestion with ammonium
acetate.</p>

<p><i>Tartrates.</i>&mdash;Addition of ammonium tartrate to a neutral
solution of rare earth salts throws down an amorphous precipitate,
which dissolves easily in acids, and in excess of the
precipitant. In the presence of tartaric acid, precipitation of
the earths by addition of sodium hydroxide is completely
inhibited. Potassium hydroxide under these conditions gives
a precipitate in the case of the yttrium elements, though only<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
on boiling; ammonia gives a crystalline precipitate even
in the cold with this group. These precipitates are alkali
double tartrates of the yttrium metals; the cerium elements
give no precipitate at all. In all cases, therefore, the precipitation
of the hydroxides is inhibited by the presence of
tartaric acid.</p>

<p>A very large number of organic salts of the rare earth
elements has been prepared and examined during the past
two decades, in the endeavour to find some class of compounds
which will allow of an easy separation of the group. The
<i>benzoates</i>, <i>succinates</i>, <i>hippurates</i>, <i>citrates</i> and similar relatively
simple salts first received attention, but less common acids,
as <i>e.g.</i> the hydroxynaphthalenesulphonic acids, have also
been employed.<a id="FNanchor169"></a><a href="#Footnote169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The use of various organic acids for the
separation and estimation of thorium in presence of the rare
earths is outlined in that connection (see <a href="#Page288">p. 288</a>). More
recently, the glycollates and cacodylates have been prepared.
The <i>glycollates</i><a id="FNanchor170"></a><a href="#Footnote170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> of the cerium elements have the general
formula R(C₂H₃O₃)₃, and crystallise in crusts; they are more
soluble than the yttrium compounds, which have the formula
R(C₂H₃O₃)₃,2H₂O, and crystallise in needles. The
<i>cacodylates</i>,<a id="FNanchor171"></a><a href="#Footnote171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
R₂[As(CH₃)₂O₂]₆, crystallise with 16 or 18 molecules of water,

<h4><span class="smcap">The Rare Earth Elements, and the Periodic
Classification</span></h4>

<p>At the time of the introduction of the periodic classification
the rare earth elements were generally believed to be divalent.
This belief, which has persisted until quite recently,<a id="FNanchor175"></a><a href="#Footnote175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> was
based chiefly on the electropositive character of the metals,
and their general chemical resemblance to the elements of
the alkaline earths; the isomorphism of the tungstates of
calcium and the cerium elements, and of the molybdates
of lead and the cerium elements, also supports this view. The
physical evidence in favour of Mendelejeff’s view, however,
is quite overwhelming; the specific heats of the metals, the
equivalent conductivities of the chlorides, and molecular
weight determinations by means of vapour densities and the
boiling point method, prove beyond doubt that the elements
are in fact trivalent.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote175"><a href="#FNanchor175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a>
See Wyrouboff, <i>Bull. Soc. franc. Min.</i> 1896, <b>19</b>, 219; Wyrouboff and
Verneuil, <i>Compt. rend.</i> 1897, <b>124</b>, 1230 and 1300; <i>ibid.</i>, 1899, <b>128</b>, 1573; etc.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In deciding in favour of the trivalent nature of the rare
earth metals, Mendelejeff was influenced chiefly by the fact
that there was no room in the table for divalent elements with
the equivalent weights then assigned to the cerium and yttrium<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
elements. At that time, only the six oxides obtained by
Mosander were known; of these the accepted equivalents
and atomic weights were as follows:</p>

</table>

<p class="noindent">the values for terbium being uncertain. If cerium be considered
trivalent in the cerous salts, its atomic weight becomes
138, that of barium being 136. Mendelejeff placed cerium
in Group IV, series 8, in the position which it still occupies;
he pointed out that the accepted equivalent must be too low,
and suggested that the atomic weight should be at least 140,
almost exactly the value accepted to-day.</p>

<p>This choice left the positions in Group III, series 8, horizontally
before cerium, and in Group IV, series 10, vertically
below it (see <a href="#Fig4">figure</a>), to be filled by the two elements, lanthanum
and didymium. No chemical evidence being available to
decide the choice, he provisionally assigned didymium to the
first (Group III, series 8), and lanthanum to the second (Group
IV, series 10) position, at the same time expressing the opinion
that didymium was probably a mixture of closely related
elements. Yttrium then fell into place in Group III, series 6,
above didymium, and erbium in Group III, series 10, below
it. To the vacant space above yttrium in Group III, series 4,
he assigned the hypothetical element Eka-boron, with atomic
weight 44; this space is now occupied by scandium, which
corresponds almost exactly in properties to the metal described
by the Russian chemist. A part of the table illustrating these
positions is shown in <a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>The determination of the specific heats of the metals by
Hillebrand and Norton in 1875, whilst confirming the trivalency
of the elements, rendered it necessary to alter the position of
lanthanum, which was placed in Group III, series 8, instead of
didymium, which was thus left without a place. This first
indication that all the rare earth elements could not be fitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
into the table without difficulties was soon followed by the
discovery of several other members of the group, for which
places could not easily be found.</p>

exception of scandium (44·1) and yttrium (89·0), the rare

barium (137·37) and tantalum (181·5). In 1902 he proposed<a id="FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
to consider the rare earth metals as a kind of zone or belt
among the elements, comparable to the asteroids in the solar
system, extending from cerium in Group IV to tantalum in
Group V in a continuous series. The suggestion seems at<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>

to the Rare Earth Elements by Brauner in 1908</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Brauner’s conception is also in accord with the physical
properties of the elements and their compounds. These vary
continuously throughout the group, and show nowhere the
sudden transitions which are characteristic of other series in
the table. Benedicts<a id="FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> has collected all the data bearing on
the atomic volumes, and finds that those also vary continuously,
with rise in the atomic weights, within quite small limits, all
lying between the values for barium and tantalum. In face
of all the evidence furnished by physical and chemical properties,
however, Brauner<a id="FNanchor178"></a><a href="#Footnote178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> has recently reverted to an idea
which he put forward in 1881, according to which lanthanum
and cerium are placed as usual in Groups III and IV, series 8,
whilst the other elements are distributed in order throughout
the remaining groups, as shown in <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<p>In support of this arrangement, he quotes the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
some of the elements appear to be able to form higher oxides
in the presence of other oxides, which act as oxygen carriers
(see <a href="#Page174">pp. 174</a>, <a href="#Page177">177-8</a>), though these higher oxides are certainly not
salt-forming. He also deduces, from the rates of hydrolysis
of the sulphates, that the elements fall into two parallel series,
according to the strengths of the hydroxides as bases, on
which ground he justifies the distribution throughout series 8
and 9. There can be no doubt, however, that this disposition
is far less in accordance with the behaviour and properties
of the rare earth elements than is the first arrangement, which
places them in a transition zone between barium and tantalum;
it is impossible, for example, to reconcile the properties of
praseodymium with those of columbium and tantalum, or to
find the slightest analogy between neodymium and molybdenum
or tungsten, as the second arrangement requires.</p>

<p>The analogy of the rare earth group to the elements of
Group VIII has been pointed out by many authors.<a id="FNanchor179"></a><a href="#Footnote179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> On the
ground that the rare earth elements cannot be spread over the
table in series 8-10, Steele<a id="FNanchor180"></a><a href="#Footnote180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> favours the early classification of
Thomsen, according to which the elements are divided into
three groups. The first, corresponding to Groups I and II
of Mendelejeff’s table, consists of two sub-groups, each containing
seven elements<a id="FNanchor181"></a><a href="#Footnote181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>; the second, corresponding to the
first two long series of the periodic table, has two sub-groups,
each of seventeen elements, of which the first and last seven
are analogous&mdash;these elements fall into the same groups in
the periodic table&mdash;whilst the middle three are interperiodic.
These interperiodic elements are those which Mendelejeff
places in Group VIII. The third division consists of one (or
two) group(s) of thirty-one elements; here again, the first
and last seven are analogous, whilst the interperiodic elements,
which are seventeen in number, include the rare earth metals.</p>

elements are arranged in order of atomic weight, but arbitrary
gaps are left in such a way that similar elements may fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
into the same vertical columns, as in the periodic table. The
arrangement has the advantage that the interperiodic elements,
consisting of the rare earth elements and the elements placed
in Group VIII of the periodic table, here do fall in the middle
of their respective periods, but it has several drawbacks, and
does not represent the transition of properties from element
to element so well as the helical representation of the periodic
table, which brings out most clearly the true relations between
the elements, and the anomalous position of the rare earth metals.</p>

<p>Mention must be made at this point of the theory of ‘Meta-elements’
put forward in 1888 by Sir William Crookes.<a id="FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> From
his work on the cathode luminescence of some of the oxides
(see <a href="#Page142">next chapter</a>), that author was led to the conclusion that
several of the then-accepted rare earth elements, notably
samarium and yttrium, were in reality heterogeneous, consisting
of large numbers of very closely related bodies, differing
so very slightly in properties that only the most refined methods
could perceive the variations; for these he proposed the
name Meta-elements. Though it has been proved that the
differences observed by Crookes in the luminescence spectra
were really due to the presence of very small quantities of
impurities, his paper is of great interest, in that it contains
a theory of evolution of the elements, and postulates the
possibility of their decay. Modern developments in radioactivity
have not only lent a curious force to these speculations,
but even support his contention that a chemical element, in
the ordinary sense of the word, is not necessarily homogeneous.<a id="FNanchor184"></a><a href="#Footnote184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
In the field of the rare earths, also, the homogeneity of elements
is even now continually being called into question (see <a href="#Ref65">Thulium</a>,
p. 204). In any case, we have in the rare earth elements a
series of bodies in which the change of properties from one
member to another&mdash;and the consequent possibility of easy
separation&mdash;is so very slight, and so far without parallel in
the whole field of chemistry, that we are at least justified in
asking whether some extension of our ordinary conception of
an element is not required.</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER X</span><br />
GENERAL METHODS OF SEPARATION</h3>

<p>The chemist who sets out to prepare a pure compound of
a rare earth element is faced by a great difficulty. The rare
earth compounds occur in nature, as one might expect from
their great similarity, as mixtures of very complex composition.
After the relatively simple separation from foreign elements
has been accomplished, the enormously greater difficulty of
separating the elements from one another has to be encountered.
So great is this difficulty, by reason of the fact that, with the
sole exception of cerium, the elements show no variation in
property sufficient to allow of the use of ordinary analytical
methods, that even at the present day it is extremely doubtful
if all the elements in the yttrium group are known to us.</p>

<p>The methods which can be adopted in attempting a separation
are of two kinds. The first includes those processes which
take advantage of the gradual variation in basic strength of
the hydroxides as the atomic weight changes; the most
important of these are fractional precipitation of the hydroxides,
and fractional decomposition of the nitrates. Fractional precipitation
of the hydroxides is generally effected by gradual
addition of ammonia, soda, magnesia, or other base, to a solution
of the mixed salts; such a solution may also be digested
with the oxides obtained by ignition of another fraction of
the rare earth compounds. If the digestion be sufficiently
complete, the precipitate in each case will be richer in the
less basic hydroxides, whilst the solution will be richer in
the salts of the more electropositive elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span></p>

<p>The fractional decomposition of the nitrates is based on
the fact that when a mixture of the salts is heated gradually,
the nitrate of the least positive element begins to decompose
first. The temperature is maintained for some time at the
point at which decomposition begins; when nitrous fumes
cease to be evolved the mixture is cooled, and extracted with
water or dilute acids. The insoluble portion&mdash;basic or superbasic
nitrate (see <a href="#Page128">p. 128</a>)&mdash;will then be richer in the less electropositive
elements; the solution is evaporated, and the solid
so obtained subjected to a somewhat higher temperature,
and the process repeated several times. In this way, a series
of fractions is obtained, in which the elements tend to distribute
themselves in order of electropositive character. By a sufficient
number of systematic repetitions of such steps, the elements
may eventually be obtained in the form of compounds of
approximate purity, which may then be refined by one of the
methods of the second kind described below. Experience has
shown, however, that a quicker and more complete separation
may generally be effected by combining two or more methods
of separation; one method will give the best separation up
to certain limits, but then becomes much less valuable; the
separation at this point is therefore taken up by another
process. A process depending on differences of basic strength
of the hydroxides is generally supplemented by a method of
the second class, i.e. a process of fractional crystallisation;
where the basicity method is not used (as, for example, in
most of the recent processes for separation of the cerium
elements), two or more different methods of fractional crystallisation
will supplement one another.</p>

<p>The methods of the second class, which are processes of
fractional crystallisation, depend on the differences in solubility
which are observed in analogous compounds in passing
from one member of the group to another. The value of these
methods, as opposed to the methods depending on differences
in basic strength, was clearly shown by Auer von Welsbach,
who in 1885 succeeded in resolving Mosander’s ‘Didymium’
into two new elements, praseodymium and neodymium, by
fractional crystallisation of the ammonium double nitrates;<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
since that date, much attention has been devoted to the task
of finding rare earth compounds which will lend themselves
to such processes. The method is extremely laborious, and
may involve several thousand recrystallisations, in consequence
of the generally very slight differences of solubility, and the
ease with which the rare earth compounds, being almost always
isomorphous with one another, form mixed crystals.</p>

<p>Whilst the method of fractional crystallisation has come
into general use for the separation of one element from another
only within the last thirty years, processes for the separation
of the cerium group from the yttrium elements, depending
on differences of solubility, have long been known and used.
The most important of these, the double sulphate method,
depends on the fact that the potassium double sulphates of
the cerium metals are almost insoluble, whilst those of the
terbium group are sparingly, and of the yttrium group readily
soluble in a concentrated solution of potassium sulphate.
The cerium elements may be thus completely removed from
a solution of mixed salts by addition of a crust of potassium
sulphate crystals, or of an hot concentrated solution of the
same reagent. In other cases, <i>e.g.</i> in the double carbonate
and double oxalate processes, separation is effected by taking
advantage of the greater tendency to the formation of double
salts possessed by the yttrium metals.</p>

<p>In effecting a separation of closely related bodies by
fractional processes, in which a large number of repetitions
of the same operation are necessary, only the most careful
and systematic procedure can avoid much waste of valuable
material; in these processes, the object of the chemist is to
obtain pure end fractions, whilst keeping the middle fractions
as small as possible. One method of procedure generally
adopted is illustrated in Fig. 7, which represents a fractional
crystallisation of a mixture of four or five substances, α, β,
... φ; the separations being usually conducted in such a
way that subgroups of three, four or five elements are first
obtained, these being then further fractionated to obtain the
pure elements. In the diagram, crops of crystals are represented
by crosses, the mother-liquors by circles; for the sake<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
of illustration, the process is made to appear as simple as
possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig7">

<img src="images/illo145.png" alt="Diagram" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7</span></p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The mixture is dissolved up, and allowed to crystallise;
the crystals are filtered off, the filtrate concentrated, and a
second crop obtained; this is repeated until five or six crops
of crystals have been obtained. These, with the mother-liquor,
constitute series A. The first fraction is now recrystallised;
it yields a crop of crystals, fraction 1 of series B,
and a mother-liquor, which is added to fraction 2 of series A,
as indicated by the dotted arrow and circle; on recrystallisation
of this mixture, a crop of crystals, fraction 2 of series B,
is obtained, together with a mother-liquor, which is recrystallised
with fraction 3 of series A. In this way, by continued
repetition, series are obtained, of which each contains one
fraction more than its predecessor; the least soluble constituent
is thus concentrated in the fractions represented on
the left of the diagram, whilst the most soluble accumulates<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
in the mother-liquors. After a greater or smaller number of
series have been traversed, according to the differences in
solubility, the end fractions in each series will be pure. These
are no longer fractionated, and the number of fractions in
each series begins to diminish, as shown on the diagram.
The middle fractions will contain the compounds of intermediate
solubility; these may be separated by further fractionation
on the same lines, or may perhaps be better treated
by a different or modified process.</p>

<p>In a modification of the method, each fraction of series A
is recrystallised separately, yielding a crop of crystals, and
a mother-liquor; series B is then built up by adding to the
crystals from fraction 2 the mother-liquor from fraction 1, to
the crystals from fraction 3 the mother-liquor from fraction 2,
and so on; the fractions in this series are then recrystallised
separately, and the third series built up by the similar combination
of the crystals and mother-liquors.</p>

<p>Similar systematic methods of procedure must be adopted
in working out any method of fractional separation; it can
at once be seen that where, as in the rare earth group, only
small variations in properties exist, much time and care must
be expended, if pure products are required.</p>

<p>Since the development of the methods of spectrum analysis,
the difficulty of testing the efficiency of a method of separation,
and of examining the purity of the products obtained, has
been greatly lessened. The only reliable test at the disposal
of the earlier chemists was the determination of the equivalent
weight, which still constitutes an important check on the
modern methods. Some account of the methods available
for the control of the methods of separation is essential in
a general account of the rare earths; but before describing
these, it will be convenient to give a short description of the
methods used in the extraction of the elements from the rare
earth minerals.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Extraction of the Rare Earths from Minerals</span></h4>

<p>With the exception of those containing large proportions
of columbium, tantalum, and titanium, the rare earth minerals<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
are easily decomposed by acids. The silicates, as a general
rule, can be satisfactorily treated with hydrochloric acid in
the ordinary way, but for large quantities, the use of sulphuric
acid is more desirable. The more refractory minerals are
completely decomposed by fused alkali hydrogen sulphate;
sodium bisulphate is more suitable for this purpose than the
potassium compound, the sodium double sulphates of the
rare earth elements being more soluble than the potassium
salts. Hydrofluoric acid also attacks the refractory minerals
very readily; the rare earths, in this case, are left as the
insoluble fluorides.</p>

<p>After decomposition with sulphuric acid or bisulphate, the
cold residue is extracted with water, the rare earth sulphates
or double sulphates being removed in solution. Digestion
with nitric acid may be necessary at this stage, if titanium,
columbium, etc., are present; after filtration, the solution is
evaporated to dryness, and the residue extracted with dilute
hydrochloric acid. The solution is saturated with sulphuretted
hydrogen to remove lead, copper, bismuth, molybdenum, etc.,
and treated in the usual way with ammonium chloride and
ammonia. The precipitate is washed, and dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, the solution heated to about 60°, and the rare
earths precipitated by addition of excess of oxalic acid, which
holds in solution any zirconium which may be present. In
the presence of phosphates, <i>e.g.</i> in the treatment of monazite
or xenotime, the precipitate of oxalates should be ignited to
the oxides, these dissolved in acid, and a second precipitation
with oxalic acid effected; this treatment is necessary to
remove phosphoric acid completely.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Preliminary examination of the earth mixture.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Before
a method of separation can be decided upon, some knowledge
of the composition of the mixture to be treated
must be obtained. The nature of the mineral used for the
extraction will, as a rule, afford useful information. It is
known that in some minerals the cerium group, in others the
yttrium group, predominates more or less completely; certain
minerals, also, are known to be rich in elements of one or
another subgroup. An approximate knowledge of the relative<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
proportions of the cerium, terbium, and yttrium groups will
be afforded by a rough double sulphate separation; thorium,
zirconium, and scandium come down with the cerium earths.
For approximate separation, Urbain<a id="FNanchor185"></a><a href="#Footnote185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> proposes the use of the
ethylsulphates. The yttrium elements can be quickly separated
in an approximate manner by fractional precipitation
of the hydroxides with magnesia. The successive fractions
obtained by these methods are examined spectroscopically;
from the results, the composition of each, and so of the original
mixture, may be roughly deduced.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Spectrum Examination</span></h4>

<p>In no department of chemistry have the methods of
spectrum analysis proved of more value than in the field
of the rare earths. They provide the chemist with a means of
following and controlling his processes of separation which is
far more delicate and decisive than the older method of determining
the equivalent weight. Whilst the examination of emission
spectra, and especially of arc spectra, is of decisive value
in every case, it has the disadvantage of requiring delicate and
complicated apparatus and great experimental skill; wherever
possible, therefore, the examination of the absorption spectra is
preferred, though this is useful only for a few of the elements,
and varies considerably with the conditions employed.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The Absorption Spectra.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Absorption in the visible region
of the spectrum is observed only with those rare earth compounds
which are coloured, and is of value, therefore, chiefly
for identification in the case of praseodymium and neodymium
among the cerium elements, and of erbium among the yttrium
metals; these give characteristic absorption bands, even in
dilute solution. The absorption spectra of the rare earth
compounds are highly characteristic, the bands being well
defined and sharply bounded, whereas coloured compounds
of the common elements show general absorption, or at best
diffuse bands, under the same conditions.</p>

<p>In observing an absorption spectrum, the light from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
Nernst lamp, or incandescent burner, is passed through a
layer of a suitable solution of the coloured compound, of
known concentration and thickness, and after collimation
is analysed by a suitable prism; the spectrum is observed
by a telescope in the ordinary way. Where accurate readings
are not required, as, for example, in testing for the presence
or absence of a particular element, the position of the bands
may be read to a sufficient degree of accuracy by means of a
scale, the image of which is adjusted to coincide with the
spectrum as seen through the eyepiece; but in mapping a
spectrum accurately, more refined methods must of course
be used. The photographic method, in which a photograph
of the spectrum is taken on a plate which bears, for purposes
of measurement, a comparison spectrum of known lines, is
very convenient for examining the absorption in the violet
and ultraviolet regions.</p>

<p>The intensity, and to some extent also the position, of
bands in an absorption spectrum may vary considerably,
according to the conditions employed. Of the various factors
which must be considered, the concentration of the solution,
the thickness of the layer used, the nature of the solvent, and
of the acid radicle, and the presence of other earths are the
most important. The concentration of the solution, and the
thickness of the layer, which together constitute the Optical
Density, must be so adjusted that the absorption is neither
too strong nor too weak; in the first case the sharp bands
tend to merge into broad diffusion areas, and details are
obscured, whilst in the second case the presence of coloured
compounds which do not show strong absorption bands may
be overlooked.</p>

<p>The nature of the acid radicle has considerable influence
on the position of the absorption maxima, the general rule
being that the bands are shifted towards the red end of the
spectrum as the molecular weight of the compound used
increases. Naturally, also, the nature of the solvent has an
important effect, all the usual phenomena which must be
considered in the measurement of the physical properties
of substances in solution coming into play; electrolytic dissociation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
hydration, dissociation and the formation of complexes,
for example, are all important factors. The presence
of colourless earths has also been found to cause important
differences. It follows, therefore, that for the chemist, the
absorption spectra can be considered as a valuable aid only
in detecting the presence or absence of the three elements
which give the strongest and most characteristic absorption
bands, viz. praseodymium, neodymium, and erbium, and that
conclusions regarding the quantitative composition of mixtures
must be drawn with the utmost caution.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The Emission Spectra: Spark Spectra.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The factors
which tend to limit the value of the absorption spectra for
analytical purposes, for the most part disappear when the
emission spectra are employed. In the case of the spark
spectra, indeed, great differences are observed according to
the conditions and method of experiment; but the arc spectra
are practically invariable under all conditions, and hence they
constitute the ultimate test in all cases. The spark spectra
are observed when one terminal&mdash;the cathode&mdash;of an induction
coil is embedded in the oxides to be examined, and the discharge
then passed. The discharge is also frequently passed
between platinum poles partly immersed in a strong solution
of a salt of the element under examination; a form of
apparatus very suitable for this method of observation has
been described by Sir W. Crookes.<a id="FNanchor186"></a><a href="#Footnote186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The spectra so obtained
are in a high degree characteristic, but they vary very considerably
with the form and dimensions of the coil, the
length and cross-section of the wires, the potential difference
employed, and so on. An entirely new spectrum also
is obtained in many cases by mere reversal of the current;
under these conditions, a phosphorescent appearance is
observed, the spectrum of which&mdash;reversed spark spectrum
of de Boisbaudran&mdash;has been found in many cases to resemble
the cathode luminescence spectra of Crookes.</p>

<p class="clearboth">&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The Arc Spectra.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The final criterion of purity in the
examination of a rare earth element is in almost all cases the<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
arc spectrum. Since for some of the elements, especially in
the yttrium group, the entire spectrum has not yet been accurately
mapped out, spectra are generally observed frequently
throughout the course of a fractionation; by this means, the
separation can be followed by the disappearance of some
lines, and the appearing or strengthening of others, and such
examinations have led occasionally to the discovery of new
elements (see, for example, under <a href="#Ref66">Separation of ytterbium
earths</a>, p. 205). Such determinations, however, require much
time and extensive and complicated apparatus.</p>

<p>Carbon electrodes are generally employed, and it is immaterial
in this case which is the anode, and which the cathode.
The lower carbon is hollowed out, and the space filled with
the oxide or sulphate of the element or mixture to be examined;
or the electrode may be impregnated with a concentrated
solution of a salt. The light is examined by means of a
diffraction grating, and the spectrum photographed on a plate
which bears a comparison spectrum for measurement. The
lines are most numerous in the violet and ultraviolet regions,
and the most characteristic spectra are given by the colourless
earths. The method is naturally more delicate for some
elements than for others; the great persistency of the scandium
line 3613·984, for example, was found very valuable by Crookes
and by Eberhard in the examination of various rocks and
minerals for that element, whilst other intense and persistent
lines have served for the detection of various rare earth elements
in the sun and many stars.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The Cathode Luminescence Spectra.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The phenomenon of
cathode luminescence, which was observed and very fully
investigated by Sir William Crookes, and which led that
author to his theory of Meta-elements, is one of the greatest
scientific interest. Crookes observed that certain of the rare
earths, when subjected to the action of cathode rays in a
vacuum tube, exhibit a brilliant phosphorescence, which,
when examined by the spectroscope, show characteristic
spectra, which differ greatly for fractions of apparently
identical chemical composition, and are otherwise distinguishable
by physical properties. The researches of Lecoq de<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
Boisbaudran, and the more recent work of Baur and Marc,<a id="FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
have shown that this luminescence is observed when a
small quantity of a coloured earth is present with a very
large quantity of a colourless earth, the maximum phosphorescence
being produced by about 1 per cent. of the coloured
earth, or ‘phosphorogen.’ The question has recently been very
fully examined by Urbain.<a id="FNanchor188"></a><a href="#Footnote188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> He shows that the sensitiveness
of the phenomenon is so great that it cannot be employed
for the ordinary purposes of chemical analysis, one part in a
million of the phosphorogen being sufficient to cause a clearly
perceptible luminescence in a pure colourless oxide.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>The Magnetic Susceptibility.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The fact that the rare
earths differ very considerably from one another in their
magnetic properties has been known for several years,<a id="FNanchor189"></a><a href="#Footnote189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and
has recently been employed by Urbain and Jantsch<a id="FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> as a
means of identification, and a test of purity, and for following
processes of fractionation. The magnetic susceptibility
reaches a minimum at samarium, and rises very sharply on
either side of that element, so that the presence of the closely
related elements, neodymium on the one side, and europium
and gadolinium on the other, which differ only very slightly
from samarium in atomic weight and solubility, can easily
be detected by this means. The property is highly additive,
and can be used, therefore, to estimate the relative proportions
of two oxides in a mixture; the determinations are said to be
easily and quickly carried out.</p>

See Urbain and Jantsch, <i>loc. cit.</i>; the values for lanthana, scandia, and
yttria were determined by Wedekind (see Meyer and Wuorinen, <i>Zeitsch. anorg.

<p>Erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutecium appear in descending

Urbain’s discovery of the new element Celtium (see <a href="#Page207">p. 207</a>).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Equivalent Weight Determination</span></h4>

<p>The determination of the mean equivalent weight, which
was for the earlier chemists the only reliable method of controlling
their fractionations, is still of considerable importance
for this purpose, especially in the yttrium group, in which
the differences in atomic weights are more considerable than
among the cerium metals. Great importance, moreover, still
attaches to these determinations, since they serve to fix the
atomic weights; save that the methods used in an atomic
weight determination are somewhat more elaborate and
refined than those used when it is desired merely to test a
fractionation, the same processes apply in both cases.</p>

<p>The methods which have been most commonly used are
those based on a determination of the ratio R₂O₃&nbsp;: R₂(SO₄)₃,
and these are of two kinds, the synthetic and the analytical.
The first, in which a known weight of the oxide is converted
into the sulphate, has been most used for the most strongly
basic oxides, since with these it is difficult to remove the last
traces of sulphuric anhydride from the oxide by heat. The
oxides are best obtained from the oxalates, which are precipitated
from an acid solution of the nitrates, washed thoroughly
with water, alcohol and ether in succession, dried, and ignited<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
in a tarred platinum crucible. The oxide is best dissolved
in dilute hydrochloric or nitric acid on the waterbath, a slight
excess of sulphuric acid being added only when a clear solution
has been obtained; the liquid is then heated gradually
to 300°, and finally in the electric furnace at 450°-550° until
constant in weight. If sulphuric acid be added directly to the
weighed oxide, particles of the latter may become completely
coated with the insoluble sulphate, and so escape the action of
the acid.</p>

<p>In the analytical method, a known weight of sulphate is
ignited to the oxide, and weighed as such. This method is
most suitable for the less basic members of the yttria earths,
of which the sulphates can be completely decomposed without
difficulty at a red heat. By the use of the microbalance, a
sufficiently accurate determination can be carried out by either of
these methods in little more than half an hour, as the chemical
changes are exceedingly rapid where only small quantities
are employed, and no time is required to allow the vessels
and solids to cool. Using the microbalance, Brill<a id="FNanchor192"></a><a href="#Footnote192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> has carried
out a series of experiments to determine the limits of
temperature within which the various steps of the process
should be carried out. He finds that a temperature of
400°-550° is required to decompose the last traces of acid
sulphate, and give the pure neutral sulphate. Between the
temperatures of 850° and 950°, basic salts are formed, from
which the last trace of sulphuric anhydride is expelled
at 900°-1150°; the precise temperature required in each
case depends, of course, on the basic strength of the oxide
in question.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The determination of equivalents by means of the ratio
R₂O₃&nbsp;: R₂(C₂O₄)₃, has been brought to a high degree of accuracy
by Brauner.<a id="FNanchor193"></a><a href="#Footnote193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> A weighed quantity of the carefully prepared
oxalate is ignited, with suitable precautions, to the oxide, in
a tarred platinum crucible. A second weighed specimen of the
same oxalate preparation is dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid,
and titrated at 60° with permanganate, which is standardised
against pure ammonium oxalate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span></p>

<p>Of the methods of volumetric analysis which have been
proposed, that put forward by Feit and Przibylla appears to
be the most suitable. A convenient quantity of oxide, which
has been ignited until constant in weight, is dissolved by gently
heating with a known excess of <span class="horsplit"><span class="top">N</span>
<span class="bot">2</span></span> sulphuric acid, in a conical
flask of Jena glass. The excess of acid is titrated with
<span class="horsplit"><span class="top">N</span><span class="bot">10</span></span>
sodium hydroxide, using methyl orange as indicator. This
method, which has the advantages of ease and quickness,
is very reliable, if suitable precautions are taken, in the case of
the more strongly basic oxides; but with the least strongly
basic members of the yttria group, the erbia and ytterbia
oxides, the end point is not very sharp, whilst with the weakly
basic scandia, the method breaks down entirely.<a id="FNanchor194"></a><a href="#Footnote194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
THE CERIUM GROUP&mdash;CERIUM</h3>

<p>The extraction of the rare earth elements from minerals,
by which they are obtained in the form of the oxalates, and the
methods of bringing these into solution, have already been
described. From the solution, before any separation of the
rare earths is attempted, thorium should be removed; for
this purpose, any of the methods described under estimation
of thorium (see <a href="#Page286">p. 286</a>) may be used, the most convenient being
the peroxide precipitation of Wyrouboff and Verneuil.</p>

<p>The solution is then treated with potassium sulphate until
the absorption bands of didymium (praseodymium and neodymium)
can no longer be observed, or appear only very faintly,
when a layer of the solution is examined with a spectroscope;
the precipitate then consists of the potassium double sulphates
of the cerium with some of the terbium elements. If the
mixture is very rich in the cerium elements, and correspondingly
poor in the yttrium elements&mdash;as, for example, the mixture
of earths obtained from monazite&mdash;Drossbach<a id="FNanchor195"></a><a href="#Footnote195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> recommends
a preliminary separation by means of the double carbonates;
the double sulphate method may then be employed to remove
the last of the yttrium and most of the terbium elements.
The sparingly soluble double sulphates of the cerium metals
may be transformed into the hydroxides by digestion with
potassium hydroxide, and these taken into solution, after
washing, by hydrochloric or nitric acid.</p>

<h4><b>Cerium</b>, Ce = 140·25</h4>

<p>Of all the rare earth elements, cerium, by virtue of its
property of forming ceric salts corresponding to the dioxide<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
CeO₂, is the one most easily separated and obtained in the
pure state. In those compounds in which it is tetravalent,
cerium functions as a much less strongly electropositive element
than in the cerous compounds, and all the methods of separation
are based on this fact. Mosander, who first demonstrated
that the old ‘ceria’ was a mixture, separated the element by
treating a suspension of the hydroxides in potassium hydroxide
with chlorine; yellow ceric hydroxide remains undissolved,
whilst the other elements go into solution as the chlorides
and hypochlorites. This method was extensively used until
quite recently; it has the advantage of separating the cerium
completely, but the product is very impure, and several repetitions
are required to give good results. The basic nitrate
method, which is now used on the commercial scale in
extracting cerium from monazite (see <a href="#Page284">p. 284</a>), is also due to
Mosander, though it has been employed subsequently by many
workers.</p>

<p>Several methods take advantage of the ease with which
the ceric salts, as compared with salts of the trivalent elements,
may be hydrolysed. Brauner<a id="FNanchor196"></a><a href="#Footnote196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> dissolves the oxides in nitric
acid, and after removal of excess of acid, boils with a large
volume of water&mdash;basic ceric nitrate is thrown down, the other
elements remaining in solution as nitrates. The precipitate
is redissolved, and the process repeated until the cerium is
found spectroscopically to be free from didymium. The hydrolysis
of the ceric salt may be effected more quickly and completely
by the addition of ammonium sulphate or magnesium acetate.<a id="FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
James<a id="FNanchor198"></a><a href="#Footnote198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> boils the solution of the nitrates with potassium
bromate, keeping the whole neutral by addition of powdered
marble; the cerium is completely and very quickly precipitated
as basic nitrate.</p>

<p>An interesting method is due to Koppel<a id="FNanchor199"></a><a href="#Footnote199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>; the oxides are
dissolved in a solution of hydrogen chloride in methyl alcohol,
and treated with pyridine, when the sparingly soluble double<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
chloride, (C₅H₅NH)₂CeCl₆, separates, and may be obtained
pure by recrystallisation from alcohol and ether. The permanganate
method of Drossbach, which is used on the commercial
scale, is described on <a href="#Page285">p. 285</a>.</p>

<p id="Footnote199"><a href="#FNanchor199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> <i>Zeitsch. anorg. Chem.</i> 1898, <b>18</b>, 305.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The cerium compounds obtained by these methods are
purified by transformation into the anhydrous sulphate,
which is dissolved in ice-water; when this solution is
allowed to come slowly to room temperature, the pure octohydrate
separates. Pure cerium salts should show no trace
of absorption when concentrated solutions are examined
spectroscopically; on ignition, the oxide obtained should be
almost colourless, having at most a faint yellow tinge. A
reddish or brownish-red shade indicates the presence of praseodymium.
An arc spectrum examination will generally show the
presence of lanthanum, which occurs in traces even in the most
carefully purified cerium preparations.</p>

<p>The preparation and properties of metallic cerium have
already been described (see <a href="#Page114">p. 114</a>); for an account of the
pyrophoric alloys, see <a href="#Page314">p. 314</a>.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Cerous Compounds</span></h5>

<p>The salts of trivalent cerium are very similar to those of
the other rare earth elements, and a detailed description of
them is therefore unnecessary. The <i>sesquioxide</i>, Ce₂O₃, cannot
be obtained by ignition of the oxalate, nitrate, or other similar
salt, since these decompose at high temperatures with formation
of the dioxide, CeO₂. It has been prepared by the reduction
of the dioxide with calcium;<a id="FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> it has a great affinity for oxygen,
and readily absorbs the gas when exposed to moist air. <i>Cerous
hydroxide</i>, Ce(OH)₃, obtained by addition of alkali to solutions
of cerous salts, has also strong reducing properties,<a id="FNanchor201"></a><a href="#Footnote201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and can
only be prepared and preserved when oxygen is carefully
excluded. It has been obtained as a perfectly white solid
by the action of water on the carbide;<a id="FNanchor202"></a><a href="#Footnote202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> when dried in an inert
atmosphere, it yields a perfectly white oxide. In presence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
air, it darkens, assuming a reddish-violet colour, which passes
into yellow as the oxidation becomes complete. The oxidation
proceeds more quickly in presence of potash or soda, ceric
hydroxide, Ce(OH)₄, being formed; in presence of potassium
carbonate, however, a dark-coloured peroxyhydrate is formed
by autoxidation. The colour so produced disappears on shaking
if an ‘acceptor’ is present, ceric hydroxide being left; if the
acceptor cannot reduce this, the solution after shaking loses the
power of re-forming the dark peroxide, but if the acceptor can
reduce the ceric compound to cerous hydroxide, the solution
after shaking regains the power of forming the peroxide which
is a property of the lower hydroxide.</p>

Muthmann and Kraft also state<a id="FNanchor205"></a><a href="#Footnote205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> that it can be prepared by

liberation of much energy in the form of heat and light; but
Dafert and Miklanz<a id="FNanchor206"></a><a href="#Footnote206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> deny that it can be obtained in this
way. Cerium nitride is a lustrous, brass yellow to bronze
coloured solid, stable in dry air, but at once attacked by
moist air, with evolution of ammonia, and formation of the
dioxide. When moistened in air with a few drops of water,
the substance reacts violently, becoming heated to redness.

<p>The solubility curve of the various <i>sulphate hydrates</i> has
already been given (see <a href="#Fig3">p. 125</a>). Various <i>double sulphates</i> with
ammonium sulphate, and the sulphates of sodium, potassium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
thallium and cadmium are known. The cadmium double
compound has the composition Ce₂(SO₄)₃,CdSO₄,6H₂O,
and is prepared by mixing solutions of the simple salts
in presence of sulphuric acid. Many <i>double nitrates</i> have
been prepared; these are for the most part stable, highly
crystalline compounds, easily soluble in water and alcohol.
With the nitrates of the common divalent metals, cerous
nitrate forms a series of double salts of the general formula
2Ce(NO₃)₃,3R(NO₃)₂,24H₂O, where R = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, or Zn;
these form an isomorphous series, crystallising in the hexagonal
system. The <i>acetylacetone compound</i> melts at 131°-132°.</p>

<p>In the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the cold, ammonia
throws down from solutions of cerous salts a reddish-brown
peroxyhydrate, Ce(OOH)(OH)₃,<a id="FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> which on heating loses
oxygen, and yields ceric hydroxide. The reaction is very
delicate, and may be used as a test for cerium. If the precipitate
be treated with acids in the cold, ceric salts are first
obtained, but these are at once reduced, in the acid solution,
by the hydrogen peroxide formed, so that cerous salts remain;
ceric salts may be obtained by first boiling the suspension of
the peroxyhydrate and treating the ceric hydroxide so obtained

<h5><span class="smcap">The Ceric Compounds</span></h5>

<p>The ceric salts are much more readily hydrolysed than the
cerous salts, and show a great tendency, in dilute solution,
to pass over into the latter. So great is this tendency that a
solution of a ceric salt acts as if it were supersaturated with
oxygen; ceric sulphate, for example, in dilute solution slowly
evolves oxygen, whilst the chloride evolves chlorine. In
consequence of this behaviour, ceric compounds have a very
powerful oxidising action. The ceric salts are yellow to red
in colour; their solutions are strongly acid, owing to the
ease with which the salts hydrolyse, and on boiling deposit
insoluble basic salts.</p>

<p>Beside the methods which have already been mentioned,
ceric compounds may be prepared from cerous by oxidation<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
with sodium peroxide, bismuth tetroxide, ammonium persulphate,
etc. In electrolysis of cerous salts, also, ceric compounds
are obtained at the anode.</p>

<p><i>Ceric hydroxide</i>, Ce(OH)₄, is obtained as a gelatinous
yellow precipitate on the addition of alkali to a solution of a
ceric salt, or by the oxidation of cerous hydroxide. The
freshly prepared precipitate dissolves in nitric acid with a
reddish colour; hydrochloric acid reduces it, with evolution
of chlorine, and formation of cerous chloride, whilst sulphuric
acid dissolves it with partial reduction, oxygen being evolved.
If a solution of a ceric compound be dialysed for some days,
a clear neutral solution is obtained, which contains the hydroxide
in the colloidal condition; by evaporation of the solution,
a gummy mass is obtained, which dissolves again in water
to a clear solution. Electrolytes rapidly cause coagulation.</p>

<p><i>Cerium dioxide</i>, CeO₂, is obtained by the ignition of any
salt of cerium with a volatile acid, or by burning the element
in oxygen; the latter reaction produces a very intense and
blinding light, on account of which cerium compounds are
often suggested for use in flashlight powders (see <a href="#Page319">p. 319</a>). The
pure oxide should be almost white, or at most a very faint
yellow, but the exact shade and appearance vary according
to the method and temperature employed in preparation,
doubtless by reason of the possibility of different degrees of
polymerisation.<a id="FNanchor210"></a><a href="#Footnote210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The oxide can act as an oxygen carrier
towards other substances, notably towards other oxides of the
rare earth group,<a id="FNanchor211"></a><a href="#Footnote211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> but the phenomena have not been fully
elucidated. In virtue of this property, the dioxide has been
proposed as a substitute for platinised asbestos in Dennstedt’s
method for the combustion of organic bodies.<a id="FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>By heating the dioxide in a stream of hydrogen, care being

<p><i>Halogen salts.</i>&mdash;No halogen compounds are known in the
free state, except the <i>fluoride</i>, CeF₄,H₂O, which was obtained
by Brauner as a yellowish-brown mass, by the action of
hydrofluoric acid on the hydroxide. A <i>double fluoride</i>,
2CeF₄,3KF,2H₂O, was prepared by the same author by
dissolving the hydroxide in potassium hydrogen fluoride; it
is insoluble in water. By dissolving a ceric salt in concentrated
hydrochloric acid, a dark red solution is obtained, which is
believed to contain the unstable complex acid, H₂CeCl₆; this
decomposes slowly in the cold, more quickly on warming, with
evolution of chlorine, and formation of cerous chloride.
Several double compounds of ceric chloride with hydrochlorides
of organic bases have, however, been obtained.</p>

<p><i>Ceric sulphate</i>, Ce(SO₄)₂, is obtained by the action of concentrated
sulphuric acid on the dioxide. It is a deep yellow
crystalline powder, dissolving readily in water to a brown
solution, which has a strongly acid reaction; on warming or<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
diluting, a basic sulphate separates. The solution slowly
evolves oxygen, and therefore always contains cerous
compounds. On evaporation, <i>a cero-ceric acid sulphate</i> of
the formula HCe<sup>iii</sup>Ce<sup>iv</sup>(SO₄)₄,12(13&nbsp;?)H₂O first separates;
the hydrated sulphate Ce(SO₄)₂,4H₂O, being more soluble,
separates on further concentration.<a id="FNanchor216"></a><a href="#Footnote216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The relative amounts
of the two compounds obtained depends on the temperature and
the concentration of acid in the solution; if both these factors
are kept low, the almost pure hydrated sulphate can be at once
obtained. This separates in yellow crystals belonging to the
rhombic system; it is readily soluble in water. The mixed
acid salt is less soluble, and forms orange prisms and needles,
which cling tenaciously to sulphuric acid. Other complex
and double salts have also been obtained. When, for example,
silver nitrate is added to a warm solution of the sulphate in
concentrated sulphuric acid, a bright orange-yellow precipitate
of the salt 10Ce(SO₄)₂,6Ag₂SO₄ is obtained.<a id="FNanchor217"></a><a href="#Footnote217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Neutral ceric nitrate is unknown. A <i>basic nitrate</i>,
Ce(NO₃)₃OH,3H₂O, is obtained in red crystals by evaporation
of a solution of ceric hydroxide in strong nitric acid. The
solid is readily soluble in water, forming a yellow, acid solution,
which becomes paler by hydrolysis, on warming or on standing.
The course of the hydrolysis is also indicated by the action
towards acids, and towards hydrogen peroxide.<a id="FNanchor218"></a><a href="#Footnote218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> A freshly
prepared ceric salt, on addition of acid, becomes immediately
much darker in colour, whereas the colour change is very
slow, if considerable hydrolysis has occurred. Similarly,
hydrogen peroxide at once reduces a freshly prepared solution,
forming colourless cerous salts, whilst if much hydrolysis has
occurred, deeply coloured higher oxidation products are at
first formed, and these lose their colour only slowly.</p>

<p>The <i>double ceric nitrates</i><a id="FNanchor219"></a><a href="#Footnote219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> are a large and very important
class of compounds; they are the most stable of the ceric
salts. With nitrates of the monovalent metals, ceric nitrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
forms double nitrates of the type R₂Ce(NO₃)₆; these are deep
red hygroscopic substances, crystallising in the monoclinic
system, readily soluble in water and alcohol, but dissolving
only sparingly in nitric acid. The ammonium salt is important
for the separation of cerium. A series of double nitrates
with the nitrates of manganese, magnesium, zinc, nickel, and
cobalt has the general formula RCe(NO₃)₆,8H₂O, but these are
much less stable in solution than the alkali double salts.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Atomic Weight of Cerium</span></h5>

<p>No less than twenty-eight separate determinations of
the atomic weight of cerium have been carried out. The
earlier determinations are rendered unreliable by the almost
certain presence of other elements, and Brauner<a id="FNanchor220"></a><a href="#Footnote220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> has shown

<p>A very careful determination was made by Robinson in
1884.<a id="FNanchor221"></a><a href="#Footnote221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Cerium oxalate was heated in a stream of dry hydrogen
chloride, mixed with carbon dioxide, and the anhydrous
chloride freed from traces of acid in a vacuum over chalk.
The weighed chloride was then dissolved in water, and titrated
with silver nitrate. He obtained the value 140·26; recalculation
from his data with the modern values for silver and
chlorine give 140·19. Brauner points out that this result
is too low, since no account was taken of the solubility of
silver chloride in water. In the following year, Brauner<a id="FNanchor222"></a><a href="#Footnote222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
determined the ratio Ce₂(SO₄)₃&nbsp;: 2CeO₂, and obtained the
atomic weight 140·22. Wyrouboff and Verneuil<a id="FNanchor223"></a><a href="#Footnote223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> in 1897
disputed Brauner’s work, and as a result of several determinations
gave the values 139·21, 139·43, and 139·50; their determinations,
however, varied very considerably, and the work
has been severely criticised by Brauner. In 1903, the latter
author and Batěk<a id="FNanchor224"></a><a href="#Footnote224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> obtained the values 140·21 and 140·27 by
the sulphate and oxalate methods respectively; whilst in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
same year, using the same methods, Brauner<a id="FNanchor225"></a><a href="#Footnote225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> obtained from
three independent series of determinations the values 140·25,
140·24, and 140·25.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Detection and Estimation of Cerium</span></h5>

<p>The detection of cerium in a mixture of earths is a comparatively
simple matter, as it has several distinctive reactions.
The brown colour of the peroxy-compounds has been suggested
as a convenient test by several authors. This may be observed
when ammonia is added to a cerous salt in presence of
hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of a large excess of
foreign earths, very dilute ammonia should be added, drop
by drop, with continuous shaking, until a small permanent
precipitate remains; this will be rich in the weakly basic
ceric hydroxide, and on addition of the peroxide solution will
show the colour clearly.<a id="FNanchor226"></a><a href="#Footnote226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> For very small quantities of cerium,
the neutral solution is added to warm concentrated potassium
carbonate solution, and one or two drops of dilute hydrogen
peroxide added to the clear liquid; the yellow colour is then
very characteristic.<a id="FNanchor227"></a><a href="#Footnote227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

cerous hydroxide; ammoniacal silver nitrate is added to the
neutral solution of the cerous salt, and the mixture warmed.
Dilute solutions (1-2 mgms. per litre) give a brown colour,
concentrated solutions a black precipitate. The oxidation of
an ammoniacal solution of the tartrate by air or hydrogen
peroxide, by which an intense yellowish brown colour is developed,
has been recently suggested by Wirth<a id="FNanchor229"></a><a href="#Footnote229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> as a very

<p>The <i>estimation</i> of cerium cannot be carried out accurately
by gravimetric methods in the presence of other earths; volumetric
methods, however, will give reasonably accurate results,
if the necessary precautions are taken. In Bunsen’s method
the ignited oxides are treated with hydrochloric acid in presence
of potassium iodide, the iodine set free from the hydriodic
acid by reduction of the cerium dioxide being estimated by
means of sodium thiosulphate, in the usual way. This method
gives very inaccurate results, since in the presence of cerium
dioxide, other oxides of the group can be converted into higher
oxides which will also liberate iodine under these conditions.</p>

<p>The most reliable method is that of v. Knorre.<a id="FNanchor233"></a><a href="#Footnote233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The
solution to be estimated is acidified with sulphuric acid, and
oxidised by means of ammonium persulphate. The excess
of the oxidising agent having been destroyed by boiling, the
cooled solution is treated with a slight excess of hydrogen
peroxide, which reduces the ceric salt according to the equation:</p>

<p class="equation">2Ce(SO₄)₂ + H₂O₂ = Ce₂(SO₄)₃ + H₂SO₄ + O₂</p>

<p class="noindent">The excess of hydrogen peroxide is then estimated by means
of a dilute permanganate solution. Permanganate is itself
reduced by the cerous salt formed, but the action is so
slow in acid solution at the ordinary temperature that
the excess of peroxide can be accurately determined without
unduly hurrying the titration. In this form the method
is generally employed for the estimation of cerium in
monazite sands, and in the incandescent mantle industry.
The greatest difficulty is the adjustment of the concentration
of the sulphuric acid required. If this be too low, basic<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
ceric sulphate separates on boiling, and the estimation fails;
if it be too high, oxidation to the ceric salt is hindered, and
may even be inhibited. This difficulty disappears in the
modified method of Waegner and Muller,<a id="FNanchor234"></a><a href="#Footnote234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> in which the oxidation
to the ceric condition is effected by means of bismuth
tetroxide in nitric acid solution. A similar method, in which
reduction to the cerous state is effected by a ferrous salt,
in place of hydrogen peroxide, has been employed by Metzger.<a id="FNanchor235"></a><a href="#Footnote235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to estimate cerium compounds
by means of permanganate, which in alkaline solution
oxidises cerous salts to the ceric condition, but the autoxidation
of cerous hydroxide in the air introduces errors, unless
suitable precautions are taken. Meyer and Schweitzer<a id="FNanchor236"></a><a href="#Footnote236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
show that if the solution of the cerous salt be added, with
constant shaking, to a known volume of a standard permanganate
solution, in presence of excess of magnesia, the liquid
being kept warm, this difficulty is overcome; the results
are usually a little high, however, probably by reason of the
oxidising action of the cerium dioxide on the other oxides
present.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lanthanum</span>, <span class="smcap">Praseodymium</span>, <span class="smcap">Neodymium</span>,
<span class="smcap">and Samarium</span></h4>

<p>In his examination of the ceria earths in 1839, Mosander
discovered a new constituent, which he called Lanthana; the
new oxide was removed in solution when the ignited mixture
was extracted with dilute nitric acid, which leaves cerium
dioxide undissolved. On examination, the new oxide was
found to be heterogeneous; by fractional precipitation with
ammonia, and subsequent recrystallisation of the sulphates, he
obtained two oxides, which he called respectively Lanthana
(λανθανειν, to be hidden), from the absence of colour and
specific reactions, and Didymia, (διδυμοι, twins) from their
similarity and the occurrence of the two together.</p>

<p>Samaria was isolated by Lecoq de Boisbaudran, in 1879,
from a specimen of didymia extracted from the mineral samarskite.
Two years previously, Delafontaine had shown that the
didymia separated from this mineral was not spectroscopically
identical with the oxide obtained from other sources, and in
1878 had isolated an oxide which he called Decipia; this was
shown later, however, to be a mixture of which samaria was one
component. The samaria obtained by de Boisbaudran was by
no means pure, being associated with terbia earths; several
investigators claimed to have separated from it new oxides,

<p>In 1885, Auer von Welsbach<a id="FNanchor238"></a><a href="#Footnote238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> employed for the first time
the method which has now become of paramount importance for
the separation of the cerium group, viz. the fractional crystallisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
of the double nitrates. By this method he succeeded in
resolving Mosander’s didymia into two new oxides, for which
he proposed the names Praseodidymia (πρασινος, leek-green),
from the colour of the salts, and Neodidymia
respectively; the shorter names praseodymia and neodymia
are, however, now generally adopted.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Separation</span></h4>

<p>The modern methods for the separation of these elements
are based almost entirely on the differences in solubility of the
various double nitrates.<a id="FNanchor239"></a><a href="#Footnote239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
The mixed double sulphates separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
by saturation of a solution of the chlorides with sodium sulphate,
which contain the cerium and most of the terbium elements, are
transformed into nitrates, and the neutral solution boiled with
potassium bromate, in presence of powdered marble, till all
the cerium is precipitated as basic ceric nitrate. From the
filtered solution the other elements are thrown down as oxalates,
transformed into the magnesium double nitrates (A in <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>),
and fractionated from nitric acid solution<a id="FNanchor240"></a><a href="#Footnote240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> until a rough
separation has been effected (fractions 1, 2, 3, and 4). The
separation, which is somewhat long and tedious, is followed by
means of the absorption spectra, and by the colour changes of
the fractions. Fraction 1, containing lanthanum and some
praseodymium, should be faint green to colourless; fraction 2
is colourless by the complementary action of the coloured salts
of neodymium and praseodymium; fraction 3, which should
contain the crude neodymium salt, is amethyst; and fraction 4,
the mother-liquor, is yellow from the presence of the samarium
compound.</p>

<p>Fraction 1 is now converted to the double ammonium
nitrates, which allow of a readier separation at this stage;
two fractions are obtained, of which the less soluble, fraction 5,
is the fairly pure lanthanum compound, whilst the more soluble,
fraction 6, contains the praseodymium with a little lanthanum.
The lanthanum ammonium nitrate, fraction 5, is converted
into the anhydrous sulphate, which is dissolved in ice-water;
when the solution is gradually warmed, the enneahydrate,
La₂(SO₄)₃,9H₂O, separates, and may be obtained perfectly
pure by recrystallisation. It is of interest that the radioactive
element actinium is chemically very similar to lanthanum, and
follows it closely through the process of separation.</p>

<p>The mixed praseodymium and neodymium magnesium
nitrates which constitute fraction 2 are transformed into the
double manganese nitrates, and the crystallisation from nitric
acid continued.<a id="FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The less soluble part, fraction 7, is fairly free
from neodymium, and the separation is continued with that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
fraction 6, until both lanthanum and neodymium have been
completely removed. The more soluble part, fraction 8,
yields the pure neodymium compound, as does also the crude
neodymium magnesium nitrate which constitutes fraction 3,
if the crystallisation be continued.</p>

<p>The double carbonate method<a id="FNanchor243"></a><a href="#Footnote243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> is very suitable for the
preparation of pure lanthanum compounds after the removal
of cerium. The mixture of salts is added to a warm 50%
solution of potassium carbonate, and to the clear liquid, water
is added gradually, with constant stirring. The double carbonates
of the most positive elements are the least soluble,
and are first thrown down, so that the precipitate is rich in
lanthanum; it is collected and washed with a 25% potassium
carbonate solution, and the process repeated. A few repetitions
suffice to separate lanthanum completely from the other members
of the group. The method may also be used for the purification
of praseodymium salts.</p>

<p>As the most electropositive element of the rare earth group,
lanthanum is the most similar in its chemical properties to the
metals of the alkaline earths. The <i>metal</i> itself (see <a href="#Page115">p. 115</a>)
oxidises even in dry air, and in moist air rapidly becomes coated
with a white layer of hydroxide; it attacks water, and burns
vigorously when heated in the air. An alloy with aluminium,
of the formula LaAl₄, has been prepared by Muthmann and
Beck<a id="FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>; it forms lustrous white crystals, very stable in the air
and very resistant towards acids.</p>

iodine to form a deep blue adsorption compound<a id="FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>; colloidal
solutions of basic lanthanum acetate are also coloured blue

distinguished from the other rare earth oxides in that it turns

liberating ammonia from ammonium salts. By fusion with

<p class="hinline">&mdash;A large number of determinations of this
constant have been made, but the results even of recent investigations
do not agree so closely as might be desired. The value
adopted by the International Committee, 139·0, is based on the
work of Brauner and Pavliček,<a id="FNanchor249"></a><a href="#Footnote249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> carried out in 1902. These
authors give an account of all the determinations made up to
that date, with critical discussion of the methods employed
and the possible sources of error. The more important investigations
have been based on the ratio La₂O₃&nbsp;: La₂(SO₄)₃,
for the determination of which the most stringent precautions
must be taken. The synthetic method has generally been
employed, on account of the tenacity with which the oxide
clings to traces of sulphuric anhydride. In this method, the
total decomposition of the acid sulphate, and the protection
of the very hygroscopic sulphate, La₂(SO₄)₃, from atmospheric
moisture, constitute the chief difficulties. By this method,
H. C. Jones<a id="FNanchor250"></a><a href="#Footnote250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> in 1902 obtained a result (138·76) considerably
lower than the value found by Brauner and Pavliček (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
A later research by Brill,<a id="FNanchor251"></a><a href="#Footnote251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> who carried out a synthetic sulphate
determination on a minute scale, using a Nernst microbalance,
gave the value 139·5, which, whilst considerably higher than

number can hardly be too high.</p>

<p>The <i>metal</i> is prepared by electrolysis of the fused chloride;
in order to attain the temperature required to fuse the element,
a very thin cathode is employed; if too powerful a current be
used, the dioxide is formed. The metal is purified by remelting
it in crucibles of magnesia, under a layer of anhydrous barium
chloride. It has a yellowish shade, and is more stable in the
air than lanthanum and cerium. For physical properties, see
p. 115. No alloys have been prepared.</p>

formula Pr₄O₇. More recent work<a id="FNanchor256"></a><a href="#Footnote256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> has shown that the composition
of the oxide obtained depends upon the conditions
under which the various salts are decomposed. By fusing the
nitrate in presence of potassium nitrate at 400-450°C., Meyer
obtained the dioxide, PrO₂; at higher temperatures this decomposes,
giving the intermediate oxides. The formation of the

less stable. It liberates halogens from the halogen acids,
and oxidises manganese salts to permanganates, but does not
completely oxidise ferrous or stannous salts, losing instead
a part of its oxygen in the gaseous form. The dioxide cannot
be obtained in the wet way.</p>

<h4><b>Neodymium</b>, Nd = 144·3.</h4>

<p>Neodymium is, after cerium, the commonest constituent
of the cerium group in the more important rare earth minerals,
and its separation is therefore by no means so difficult as
that of praseodymium. The compounds of the element
obtained by von Welsbach in 1885 were not pure, being admixed
with samarium compounds which had not been completely
separated. Neodymium salts were first prepared
free from samarium by Demarçay<a id="FNanchor268"></a><a href="#Footnote268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> in 1898; they are of a
violet-rose colour, and show in solution a well-marked and
characteristic absorption spectrum, the bands being very
numerous and sharply defined, and extending over the whole
optical region. In chemical as well as in physical and crystallographic
properties, they show an extremely close resemblance
to the compounds of praseodymium.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote268"><a href="#FNanchor268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> <i>Compt. rend.</i> 1898, <b>126</b>, 1039.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>On account of the high melting-point, the preparation of
the <i>metal</i> presents the same difficulties as that of praseodymium.
A current of 90-100 ampères is employed at a
potential difference of 15-22 volts; this suffices to raise the
thin carbon cathode to a bright white heat, and to fuse the
liberated metal. For the properties of the element, see <a href="#Page115">p. 115</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>sesquioxide</i>, Nd₂O₃, when perfectly pure, has a light
blue or lilac colour, with a faint reddish fluorescence; the
shade varies somewhat according to the method of and temperature
employed for the preparation. A bluish or violet-red
fluorescence is highly characteristic of the salts, and is particularly
noticeable if the powdered recrystallised oxalate be viewed
in a good light. The greyish or brownish colour of the oxide
observed by some authors is probably due to traces of impurity.<a id="FNanchor269"></a><a href="#Footnote269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
The existence of higher oxides of the formulæ Nd₂O₄ and Nd₂O<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>₅
respectively, which Brauner<a id="FNanchor270"></a><a href="#Footnote270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> put forward, has been disputed by
other writers, though it is found<a id="FNanchor271"></a><a href="#Footnote271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> that in the presence of ceria
and praseodymia, the sesquioxide can take up more oxygen.
Waegner<a id="FNanchor272"></a><a href="#Footnote272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> claimed to have obtained the compound Nd₄O₇ by
heating the oxalate in a stream of oxygen, though his material,
as well as that of Brauner, contained praseodymia. More
recently, Joye and Garnier<a id="FNanchor273"></a><a href="#Footnote273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> have shown that the spectrum
attributed by Waegner to the hypothetical Nd₄O₇ was in
reality that of an hydrated oxide, 2Nd₂O₃,2H₂O; these authors
have also prepared a second hydrated oxide of the formula
2Nd₂O₃,3H₂O.</p>

<p>The <i>chloride</i>, NdCl₃,6H₂O, is obtained by crystallisation
from aqueous solutions; it is also precipitated by addition
of water to an alcoholic solution. It forms large deliquescent
rose-coloured crystals; 100 parts of water at 13° dissolve
246·2 parts of the salt, the saturated solution having the
density 1·741; at 100°, 511·6 parts are dissolved. The
solution resembles those of the other chlorides of the group
in that it readily dissolves the rare earth oxalates. When
heated in a current of hydrogen chloride of 130°, the hexahydrate
yields a monohydrate, NdCl₃,H₂O; at 160° the

were shown by spectroscopic examination<a id="FNanchor293"></a><a href="#Footnote293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> to be free from
other earths. The element is intermediate in electropositive
character and in the solubility relations of its salts between
neodymium and the terbium earths; its salts are topaz-yellow
in colour, and in concentrated solutions show absorption
in the blue and violet regions. The oxide is almost white in
colour, with only a faint yellow tinge. A systematic
investigation of samarium compounds was carried out by
Cleve,<a id="FNanchor294"></a><a href="#Footnote294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> but his work was vitiated by the fact that his
material was very impure. More recently, the pure salts have

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
THE TERBIUM GROUP</h3>

<p>In his examination of the yttria earths in 1842, Mosander
described two new oxides isolated from the old yttria. To one
of these, an orange-yellow earth which yielded colourless
salts, he gave the name Erbia; the second earth, which was
colourless and gave rose-coloured salts, he called Terbia.
Bahr and Bunsen examined the yttria oxides in 1866, and
obtained only the latter earth, which gave rose-coloured salts;
to this they applied Mosander’s name Erbia, and stated that
the earth to which Mosander had given that name had no
existence. Delafontaine, however, confirmed Mosander’s work,
showing that the orange-yellow earth which yielded colourless
salts (Mosander’s Erbia) had been fractionated out of their
material by Bahr and Bunsen in the double sulphate separation
of the cerium group; to avoid further confusion, however, he
proposed to give to this oxide (Mosander’s Erbia) the name
Terbia, leaving for the colourless oxide, which forms rose-coloured
salts (which Mosander had called Terbia) the name
Erbia applied to it by Bahr and Bunsen. This reversed
nomenclature has been generally accepted.</p>

<p>Delafontaine,<a id="FNanchor300"></a><a href="#Footnote300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> continuing his work on the earths from
samarskite (see <a href="#Page168">p. 168</a>) announced in 1878 the discovery of a
new oxide, Philippia, intermediate between terbia and yttria;
but this was subsequently shown to be a mixture of yttria
and terbia (see <a href="#Page133">p. 133</a>). In the same year,
Lawrence Smith<a id="FNanchor301"></a><a href="#Footnote301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
announced the discovery of another oxide, Mosandria, from
the samarskite earths; this was afterwards shown by Lecoq de
Boisbaudran to be a mixture of terbia with gadolinia.<a id="FNanchor302"></a><a href="#Footnote302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
In 1880<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
Marignac<a id="FNanchor303"></a><a href="#Footnote303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> announced the discovery of two more new oxides,
Y<sub>α</sub> and Y<sub>β</sub> from the same mineral; Y<sub>β</sub> was afterwards found
to be identical with samaria, whilst Y<sub>α</sub> was subsequently
separated from the old terbia earths by Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
who proposed, with the assent of Marignac, the name Gadolinium.<a id="FNanchor304"></a><a href="#Footnote304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
The terbia left after removal of the erbia earths and
gadolinia was believed by that author to be still a mixture, a
conclusion supported by the work of Hofmann and Kruss
in 1893.<a id="FNanchor305"></a><a href="#Footnote305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The complicated history of the terbium group has been
entirely cleared up by the work of Urbain and his co-workers
during the early years of the present century, and processes
have been devised by which the separation of the three members
of the group from one another, and from the related elements
of the erbium group on the one side, and samarium on the
other, can be satisfactorily accomplished. The chemistry
of this group, therefore, may be regarded as satisfactorily
settled, though relatively little is known of the properties
of the elements and their compounds.</p>

<p>In their general chemical relations, elements of the terbium
group occupy an intermediate position between the cerium
group and the elements of the yttrium group in the narrower
sense. In the solubility relations of the double salts, they are
bounded on the one side by samarium and the less soluble
cerium group, on the other by dysprosium and holmium and
the more soluble yttrium group. They show only very slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
differences in electropositive character, and methods based on
differences in basic strength of the oxides, therefore, are of very
little use for separating them from one another. Fractional
precipitation with ammonia separates them in the order
terbium, samarium, gadolinium, and europium&mdash;samaria being
less strongly basic than the oxides of gadolinium and europium;
this constitutes an exception to the general rule regarding
the solubilities of the double nitrates and sulphates with
increasing electropositive character.<a id="FNanchor310"></a><a href="#Footnote310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The difficulties of
separation are greatly increased by the very small proportions
in which the elements are usually found in rare earth minerals.
Gadolinium usually occurs in the largest quantities; in consequence
of this, there is little doubt that most of the material
described by the earlier workers as terbia consisted very largely
of gadolinia.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote310"><a href="#FNanchor310"><span class="label">[310]</span></a>

<p>The group is not characterised by well-marked absorption
spectra; europium and terbium show weak absorption in the
blue region. Terbium, of which the salts are colourless, forms
a very strongly coloured peroxide, analogous to that of praseodymium;
small quantities of this give to the mixed oxides
obtained by ignition the characteristic yellow colour, whilst
mixtures richer in the peroxide become correspondingly darker
and darker.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Separation</span></h4>

<p>In the double sulphate separation of the yttrium and
cerium groups, the terbium elements divide themselves between
the soluble and the insoluble portions; if the separation is
made as complete as possible by addition of a large excess of
alkali sulphate under suitable conditions, the larger part of
the compounds of the group will be precipitated with the
cerium elements. In the separation of the cerium elements
the terbium elements collect in the most soluble fractions,
and the mother-liquors of the double nitrate crystallisations
therefore form a very convenient source of these elements.
A considerable proportion, however, will usually remain in
solution with the double sulphates of the yttrium group; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
the bromate separation of these (see <a href="#Page198">p. 198</a>), the terbium
elements collect in the least soluble fractions. By careful
fractionation under suitable conditions, the double sulphate
method may be used to separate the terbium group completely
from the cerium and yttrium elements. A very convenient
method of separating the terbium group from a rare earth
mixture is the ethylsulphate process of Urbain. By fractional
crystallisation of these salts from alcohol or water, the separation
into three groups can be satisfactorily accomplished.</p>

<p>For the separation of the terbium elements from one
another, the nitrate and double nitrate methods are most
suitable. Samarium can readily be separated by crystallisation
of the double magnesium nitrates in presence of bismuth
magnesium nitrate; by continuing the fractionation, europium
magnesium nitrate can be separated in a pure state, as there
is a considerable difference between the solubility of this
salt and the corresponding compound of gadolinium;<a id="FNanchor311"></a><a href="#Footnote311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> the
process, however, is somewhat long and tedious. For the
separation of gadolinium and terbium, the double nitrates
are converted into the simple nitrates, and these fractionated
from nitric acid in presence of bismuth nitrate. The gadolinium
nitrate separates before the bismuth nitrate, and may
be obtained fairly pure in this way, though the process is
extremely tedious, and several thousand recrystallisations
are required.<a id="FNanchor312"></a><a href="#Footnote312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Terbium nitrate has almost the same solubility
as bismuth nitrate, and the two separate together in
the middle fractions. The more soluble nitrates of the erbia
earths collect in the mother-liquors.</p>

to contain about 0·002 per cent. of the oxide, though on account
of the remarkable intensity of some of the stronger lines in

<h4><b>Gadolinium</b>, Gd = 157·3.</h4>

<p>Gadolinia is the commonest of the terbia oxides, and occurs
in considerable quantities in some of the rare earth minerals,
notably in samarskite and gadolinite; its separation from
the neighbouring oxides, europia and terbia, is, however,
exceedingly difficult, and has only been satisfactorily
accomplished in recent times. The gadolinium compounds
prepared and examined by the earlier workers, as appears
from the atomic weight determinations, must have been
associated with earths of lower atomic weight, and undoubtedly
also with small quantities of terbium. After the isolation of
Marignac’s Y<sub>α</sub>, and the examination of the element by Lecoq
de Boisbaudran, to whom the name gadolinium is due, further
investigations were carried out by Bettendorff<a id="FNanchor323"></a><a href="#Footnote323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and by
Benedicts.<a id="FNanchor324"></a><a href="#Footnote324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Pure gadolinia was probably first obtained by
Demarçay,<a id="FNanchor325"></a><a href="#Footnote325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> by fractional crystallisation of the magnesium

<p>The <i>hydroxide</i>, Gd(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate with
strongly basic properties, rapidly absorbing carbon dioxide
from the air. The <i>oxide</i>, Gd₂O₃, also absorbs carbonic
anhydride from the air, and is easily soluble in acids,
even after strong ignition. The element is therefore strongly
electropositive. Its position among the yttrium elements,
however, is justified by the properties of the <i>platinocyanide</i>,
2Gd(CN)₃,3Pt(CN)₂,18H₂O, which forms long, pointed red
crystals, with a green metallic lustre, belonging to the rhombic
system, and isomorphous with the corresponding yttrium
and erbium salts; the cerium elements, on the other hand,
give yellow platinocyanides, with a blue metallic lustre, which
crystallise in the monoclinic system.</p>

<p>The <i>nitrate</i>, Gd(NO₃)₃,6H₂O, separates from aqueous solutions
at the ordinary temperatures in large crystals belonging to
the anorthic system, and is isomorphous with the corresponding
compounds of praseodymium and neodymium.<a id="FNanchor330"></a><a href="#Footnote330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> From solutions
in strong nitric acid, a pentahydrate is obtained, which
melts at 92°; the hexahydrate melts at 91°. The <i>sulphate</i>
separates from aqueous solution as the octohydrate,
Gd₂(SO₄)₃,8H₂O, isomorphous with the corresponding salts
of both groups. The anhydrous sulphate is much less soluble
in water at 0° than the corresponding compounds of the cerium
elements. The <i>selenate</i> forms hydrates with 10 and 8 molecules
of water of crystallisation respectively; these are isomorphous
with the corresponding selenates of yttrium and the erbium
metals.</p>

<h4><b>Terbium</b>, Tb = 159·2</h4>

<p>Terbia occurs among the rare earth oxides in exceedingly
small quantities, and its separation has in consequence presented
such great difficulties that only within the last few years
have terbium compounds been completely freed from gadolinium
and neighbouring elements. In 1886 Lecoq de Boisbaudran,<a id="FNanchor338"></a><a href="#Footnote338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
by fractional precipitation of the hydroxides with
ammonia, and subsequent fractional crystallisation of the
double sulphates, obtained an oxide much richer in terbia<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
than any specimen previously prepared; it was dark yellow
in colour. In 1902 Marc<a id="FNanchor339"></a><a href="#Footnote339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> obtained from monazite a very dark
oxide containing about 15 per cent. of terbia, whilst Feit<a id="FNanchor340"></a><a href="#Footnote340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> in
1905 obtained a dark brown oxide consisting of gadolinia with
about 13 per cent. of terbia. Pure terbium compounds were
obtained by Urbain in 1904,<a id="FNanchor341"></a><a href="#Footnote341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> by fractional crystallisation of
the nitrate from nitric acid, in presence of bismuth nitrate,
and by crystallisation of the double nickel nitrates, and
precipitation with ammonia; he showed that the element
was identical with the Z<sub>δ</sub> and Z<sub>β</sub> of de
Boisbaudran,<a id="FNanchor342"></a><a href="#Footnote342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> with

salts.<a id="FNanchor345"></a><a href="#Footnote345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The <i>peroxide</i>, of which the composition corresponds
approximately to the formula Tb₄O₇, is obtained as a brownish-black
powder by ignition of suitable salts. Its presence, even
in small quantities, gives so deep a colouration to the other
earths that some kind of salt formation seems probable. It
is insoluble in cold acids; it dissolves in hot nitric acid with
evolution of oxygen, forming a solution from which the <i>nitrate</i>,
Tb(NO₃)₃,6H₂O, melting at 89·3°, separates on cooling. In
hot hydrochloric acid, the peroxide dissolves with evolution of
chlorine, forming solutions from which the <i>chloride</i>, TbCl₃,6H₂O,
can be isolated with difficulty; this salt is extremely deliquescent,
and easily forms supersaturated solutions. The <i>sulphate</i>,
Tb₂(SO₄)₃,8H₂O, can be precipitated from a sulphuric acid
solution of the oxide by addition of considerable quantities
of alcohol; it is isomorphous with the other sulphate octohydrates,
and is completely dehydrated at 360°.</p>

THE ERBIUM AND YTTERBIUM GROUPS&mdash;YTTRIUM
AND SCANDIUM</h3>

<p>In his examination of the ‘Yttria’ of Gadolin and Ekeberg,
during the years 1839 to 1843, Mosander, by methods based on
differences in strength of the oxides as bases, separated the
earth into three new oxides, yttria proper, the most strongly
basic, terbia, intermediate in strength, and erbia,<a id="FNanchor348"></a><a href="#Footnote348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> the least
basic. No further separation was effected until 1878, when
Marignac, by fractional decomposition of the nitrates, separated
from erbia a new oxide, for which he proposed the name
Ytterbia; the new oxide was the least basic of the erbia earths.
In the following year, Nilson<a id="FNanchor349"></a><a href="#Footnote349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> isolated from ytterbia a still
less basic oxide, by the same method; he proposed the name
Scandia, to recall the fact that it occurred in gadolinite and
euxenite, which up to that time had been found only in Scandinavia.
In 1879 also, Soret<a id="FNanchor350"></a><a href="#Footnote350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> announced the discovery of a new
element X, evidence for the existence of which he had obtained
during a spectroscopic examination of a mixture of erbia and
terbia earths; the oxide of X was isolated in the same year by
Cleve<a id="FNanchor351"></a><a href="#Footnote351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> from the old erbia, by fractional decomposition of the
nitrates, and the name Holmium, from the town of Stockholm,
was proposed for the new element. The same investigation led
to the discovery of Thulium, which derives its name from
Thule, an old name for Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Lecoq de Boisbaudran<a id="FNanchor352"></a><a href="#Footnote352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> in 1886 showed Cleve’s Holmia
to be a mixture of at least two oxides; he retained the name
Holmium for the element which gave the most characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
absorption bands of the old holmium, and proposed the name
Dysprosium (from δυσπροσιτος, difficult of access) for the
second element. The name Erbia was retained for the oxide
remaining after the removal of holmia, thulia, and dysprosia
from the old erbia; the homogeneity of this erbia has been
called in question, but is now fairly firmly established. The
individuality of dysprosium<a id="FNanchor353"></a><a href="#Footnote353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
and holmium<a id="FNanchor354"></a><a href="#Footnote354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> may also be
regarded as definitely established; that of thulium remains
doubtful (see <a href="#Page204">p. 204</a>).</p>

<p>The homogeneity of ytterbia was questioned by Auer von

double oxalates, that author isolated the oxides of two new
elements, for which he proposed the names Aldebaranium
and Cassiopeium. By fractionation of the nitrates from
nitric acid solution, Urbain<a id="FNanchor356"></a><a href="#Footnote356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> arrived at the same result, and
proposed the names Ytterbium (Neoytterbium) and Lutecium,
which have been adopted by the International Committee.
The latter author, employing the same method in the fractionation
of the gadolinite earths, has recently obtained very
strong evidence of the existence in this group of another
element, for which he proposes the name Celtium;<a id="FNanchor357"></a><a href="#Footnote357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> the

<h4><span class="smcap">Separation</span></h4>

<p>In the separation of the yttrium elements, methods based
on differences in electropositive character are of much greater
importance than in the separation of the cerium and terbium
groups, and the method of nitrate fusion has been very largely
employed even in comparatively recent work. This method,
which was introduced by Berlin in 1860, has been of great
value in the separation of yttrium and the ytterbium elements
from the erbium group; it was employed in the isolation of
ytterbium by Marignac, and of scandium by Nilson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span></p>

<p>If a concentrated solution of the nitrates be evaporated
down, and the syrupy residue subjected to gradually increasing
temperature, the nitrates of the ytterbium elements and
scandium are converted first into the basic nitrates; at somewhat
higher temperatures the erbium salts are decomposed,
whilst yttrium nitrate and the nitrates of any cerium elements
present are the last to break up. If the mixture of basic and
neutral nitrates be dissolved in boiling water, the former, being
less soluble, crystallise out on cooling, and may be separated
by this means, the process being repeated with the filtrate
containing the unchanged nitrates. In this way, the weakly
basic scandia and ytterbia quickly collect in the first fractions,
whilst the oxides of the erbia group are easily separated from
the more strongly basic yttria. The presence of the intermediate
terbium group renders the process much less easily
workable.</p>

<p>The process may be modified by raising the temperature
to such an extent that the soluble basic nitrates are converted
into insoluble superbasic nitrates, the temperatures at which
this change occurs increasing from element to element as the
positive character becomes more marked; the mixture of
basic and superbasic salts is then extracted with dilute nitric
acid which leaves that latter undissolved and removes the more
positive elements in solution.</p>

<p>Fractional precipitation of the hydroxides by means of
ammonia, alkalies, or alkaline earths has also been frequently
employed. A modification of this process is the precipitation
with aniline, carried out by Kruss;<a id="FNanchor358"></a><a href="#Footnote358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> in this method, the
solution of the chloride in warm dilute alcohol is treated with
an alcoholic solution of the organic base. Another modification
is the ‘Oxide process’ employed by Auer von Welsbach<a id="FNanchor359"></a><a href="#Footnote359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
for the separation of the cerium elements, and by Drossbach<a id="FNanchor360"></a><a href="#Footnote360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
in the yttrium group. The concentrated solution of the mixed
salts is thoroughly digested with the oxides obtained by precipitating
a fraction of the earths; the more strongly basic
oxides tend to displace the less basic, so that these accumulate
in the insoluble part. The solution is filtered from the undissolved
oxides, another fraction precipitated, and the oxides
obtained from the precipitate digested with the concentrated
solution as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span></p>

<p>The more modern methods of separation combine the
above processes with the methods of fractional crystallisation,
for which the bromates and alkylsulphates of these elements
are well adapted. The procedure<a id="FNanchor361"></a><a href="#Footnote361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> which experience shows
will lead to a fairly rapid separation is roughly represented
in <a href="#Fig9">Fig 9</a>. The double sulphates (B), left in solution after
removal of the cerium and part of the terbium group, are
transformed into the bromates, which are separated by
fractional crystallisation into five main fractions. The least
soluble portion, fraction 1, contains the terbium elements
with some dysprosium; in the fractionation of the terbium
group by means of the nitrates and double nitrates, the dysprosium,
with some terbium, collects in the final fractions
(fraction 6). Fraction 2 contains terbium, dysprosium, holmium,
and yttrium as the bromates; these are converted into
the anhydrous chlorides, from which, by treatment with
sodium ethylsulphate in alcoholic solution, the ethylsulphates
are obtained. By fractional crystallisation, dysprosium may
be obtained in a fairly pure condition (fraction 7), the least
soluble part (fraction 6) containing the terbium with some
dysprosium. Holmium and yttrium collect in the most
soluble part (fraction 8), from which pure holmium can be
obtained by the method of nitrate fusion. Fraction 3 contains
yttrium and erbium, with small quantities of dysprosium and
holmium; the latter are readily separated by the nitrate
fusion, which will also allow of a fairly complete separation
of yttrium (fraction 9). Fraction 4 contains yttrium and
erbium; scandium if present will also collect here. Erbium
can be obtained pure by the nitrate fusion; the second fraction
from this process contains both yttrium and erbium, and may
be further worked up with the fraction of similar composition
(fraction 10) from fraction 3.</p>

<p>The mother-liquors from the bromate separation (fraction 5)<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
contain thulium and the ytterbium elements; the crystallisation
is continued, and allows of complete separation of
thulium and ytterbium, and probably of lutecium, though the
most soluble fractions do not seem to have been fully separated.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Erbium Group</span></h4>

<p>The oxides of this group, as contrasted with the ytterbia
oxides, give rise to coloured salts, which in solution show
definite absorption spectra in the optical region; the spectrum
of erbium salts is particularly definite and characteristic.
Erbium has among the yttrium elements the place of
neodymium among the cerium elements; after yttria, erbia
is the commonest oxide of the yttria group, though on account
of the difficulties of separation the chemistry of erbium is
by no means so complete and definite as that of neodymium.
The oxides in order of decreasing basicity, as shown by the
order in which they are thrown down by ammonia, are:
dysprosia, holmia, erbia, thulia; the electropositive character
becomes weaker, therefore&mdash;as generally in the rare earth
series&mdash;as the atomic weight of the elements increases.</p>

<h5><b>Dysprosium</b>, Dy = 162·5</h5>

<p>Compounds of this element were probably prepared in the
pure state for the first time by Urbain<a id="FNanchor362"></a><a href="#Footnote362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in 1906, by the fractional
crystallisation of the ethylsulphate. He showed that after
fourteen recrystallisations, the absorption spectrum of the
salts and the mean atomic weight of the element remain
unaltered, and that after removal of terbium by the very
efficient ethylsulphate method, all remaining traces of yttrium
could be rapidly removed by crystallisation of the nitrate.
The salts have generally a more or less pronounced yellow
colour.</p>

(two series), of the double ammonium oxalates, and finally
fractional precipitation of the hydroxides by ammonia.</p>

<p>He determined the <i>Atomic Weight</i> as 163·5, which is the

powder; the <i>salts</i> are yellow, with a faint orange tinge.</p>

<h5><b>Erbium</b>, Er = 167·7</h5>

<p>Although erbia was separated by Mosander seventy years
ago, it is doubtful if the perfectly pure oxide has ever been
prepared. Whilst the individuality of the element is well
established, its homogeneity has frequently been called in
question. The name ‘Neo-Erbia’ was given by Cleve<a id="FNanchor372"></a><a href="#Footnote372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> to the
residue left after the separation from the old erbia of ytterbia,
scandia, thulia, and holmia (with which dysprosia (<i>q.v.</i>) was
also separated), but the spectrum examination of Kruss
and Nilson<a id="FNanchor373"></a><a href="#Footnote373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> led them to regard Cleve’s oxide as still complex.
Their results, however, were explained by the work of Hofmann
and his pupils,<a id="FNanchor374"></a><a href="#Footnote374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> who consider erbia to be a homogeneous
product; the homogeneity of the element, therefore, may be
considered as established, though it would be strengthened
by a more complete knowledge of the neighbouring elements,
holmium and thulium.</p>

possess this property;<a id="FNanchor375"></a><a href="#Footnote375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> the reflection spectrum remains
unchanged in the presence of foreign oxides, provided no
combination occurs. From the atomic weight determinations,
it seems clear that the salts described by Cleve and his pupils<a id="FNanchor376"></a><a href="#Footnote376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>

<p>The <i>sulphate</i> separates from aqueous solutions at ordinary

sulphate is formed by long heating at 400°, more quickly at
475°, and can be heated to 630° without decomposition. At
845° a basic salt, Er₂O₃,SO₃, is formed, which begins to decompose

<h5 id="Ref65"><b>Thulium</b>, Tm = 168·5</h5>

<p>The thulia isolated in 1879 was described by Cleve<a id="FNanchor384"></a><a href="#Footnote384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> as
pale rose in colour; in the following year, having obtained
it in larger quantity, he found that it was white, and dissolved
in acids to form colourless solutions which showed absorption
bands in the red and blue. The spectra of the thulium compounds
prepared by Cleve were examined by Thalèn,<a id="FNanchor385"></a><a href="#Footnote385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> who
concluded that a new element was certainly present, though
it had not been freed from ytterbium and erbium. Incidental<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
observations on the new oxide were made by various investigators,
but no extensive researches were carried out upon it
until 1911, when James<a id="FNanchor386"></a><a href="#Footnote386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> published an account of the separation
and purification by the bromate method, stating that after
some 15,000 operations, his products remained unaltered;
he gives, however, no spectroscopic determinations, though
part of his material, spectroscopically examined by Sir William
Crookes, was described as ‘Very good thulium, with a trace
of ytterbium.’ In the same year Auer von Welsbach<a id="FNanchor387"></a><a href="#Footnote387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> published
an account of a spectroscopic investigation, as a result
of which he concludes that thulium is a mixture of at least
three elements, of which the second, Tm II, agrees fairly well
in properties, so far as the two accounts allow of comparison,
with the thulium of James.</p>

<p>Thulia is described by James as a dense white powder,
with a greenish tinge, which ‘emits a carmine coloured glow,
when carefully made to incandesce.’ The salts have a greenish
tint, very susceptible to traces of erbium; addition of erbium
compounds turn the solution first yellowish-green, then colourless,
and finally pink. von Welsbach describes Thulium II as
forming an almost white sesquioxide, which, when heated
in the flame, gives a purplish light quickly succeeded by a
splendid characteristic glow; the salts are pale yellowish-green
by daylight, emerald-green by artificial light, the colour
being almost complementary to that of erbium salts. In
solution, salts of Tm II give the bands at 685 and 464 ascribed
by James and other workers to thulium.</p>

<p>Until further researches on these interesting results are
published, the elementary nature of thulium cannot be considered
definitely settled; it appears probable, however, that
homogeneous salts of a definite element were obtained by
James. The following salts are described by James (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>chloride</i>, TmCl₃,7H₂O, separates at ordinary temperatures
from the concentrated solution of the oxide in
hydrochloric acid as greenish crystals, very soluble in alcohol
and water. The <i>bromate</i>, Tm(BrO₃)₃,9H₂O, forms pale bluish-green<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
hexagonal prisms, isomorphous with the analogous
salts of the group. The <i>sulphate</i> and <i>nitrate</i> separate as
the octohydrates. The precipitated <i>oxalate</i> has the formula
Tm₂(C₂O₄)₃,6H₂O, and is soluble in excess of alkali
oxalate. The <i>acetylacetone derivative</i> was prepared by dissolving
the precipitated and well-washed hydroxide in
alcoholic acetylacetone; it recrystallises from absolute (?)
alcohol as the dihydrate, Tm₂(C₅H₇O₂)₆,2H₂O. The <i>phenoxyacetate</i>,
Tm₂(C₆H₅·O·CH₂·COO)₆,6H₂O, was obtained in a
similar manner by addition of the hydroxide to a solution
of phenoxyacetic acid in dilute alcohol.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Atomic Weight.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Cleve gave the value 170·7 for this
constant, but his material was very impure. In a footnote
to a paper published in 1907, Urbain<a id="FNanchor388"></a><a href="#Footnote388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> pointed out that the
value could not be above 168·5. Analyses of the salts prepared
by James agree fairly well with the theoretical values calculated
on this basis, but a systematic determination with pure material
has not yet been made. The International Committee (1912)
have adopted the value 168·5.</p>

<p>The <i>oxides</i>, R₂O₃, though perfectly white, are coloured
yellow or brown by the faintest traces of thulium. They are
attacked by acids only slowly in the cold, but dissolve readily
on warming; lutecia is slightly the less strongly basic. The
<i>chlorides</i> crystallise with six molecules of water, and are extremely
soluble and deliquescent; when heated in a stream
of hydrogen chloride, they form oxychlorides of the type ROCl.
The <i>platinocyanides</i> crystallise with 18 molecules of water,
and have the characteristic appearance of the analogous
compounds of the yttrium elements. The <i>sulphates</i> crystallise
at all temperatures as the normal octohydrates, and are
moderately easily soluble in water; conductivity measurements
show that they are partially hydrolysed in solution. The
<i>nitrates</i> crystallise from concentrated aqueous or nitric acid
solutions as the tetrahydrates; by evaporation of the aqueous
solutions over sulphuric acid, the trihydrates are obtained.
These compounds are anomalous among the rare earth nitrates,
by reason of their low water content. The neutral <i>carbonates</i>
are thrown down by ammonium carbonate as the tetrahydrates;
if a stream of carbon dioxide be led into aqueous
suspension of the hydroxides, <i>basic carbonates</i> of the formula
R(OH)CO₃,H₂O, are obtained. The <i>oxalates</i> are precipitated

<h5><b>Celtium</b></h5>

<p>The separation of Marignac’s ytterbium into the two
elements described above was accomplished by Urbain with
the yttria earths extracted from xenotime. In carrying out<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
the same process with the ytterbia earths from gadolinite,
that author<a id="FNanchor396"></a><a href="#Footnote396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> obtained from the mother-liquor an earth for
which the coefficient of magnetisation was found to be 4·1 ×
10⁻⁶; lutecia has a coefficient three to four times as great.
A spectroscopic examination revealed the presence of lines
which did not correspond with those of any known body,
and Urbain considered that a new element, for which he
proposed the name Celtium, with the symbol Ct, must be
present. Lutecia from xenotime shows no trace of the new
element.</p>

<h5><b>Yttrium</b>, Yt = 89·0</h5>

<p>Since the separation of yttria proper from the old yttria
earths by Mosander, in 1842, the individuality of yttrium
has been well established. The yttria of the workers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
sixties and seventies, to judge from the atomic weight determinations,
must have been very impure, but no doubts were
raised as to its homogeneity. By examination of the cathode
luminescence spectra, Crookes<a id="FNanchor399"></a><a href="#Footnote399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> concluded that the oxide was
of a complex nature; Lecoq de Boisbaudran, however, showed
that the phenomena observed by Crookes were due to traces
of impurity in his material, a conclusion confirmed by the
work of Baur and Marc.<a id="FNanchor400"></a><a href="#Footnote400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>The oxide is the most strongly basic of all the yttria earths;
in the basicity methods of separation, therefore, it collects
in the end fractions, and is easily separated from the erbia
and ytterbia earths by the nitrate fusion and similar processes.
The terbia earths, however, which are comparable to it in
basic strength, cannot be easily separated by such methods;
processes of fractional crystallisation are very convenient in
this case, since yttrium falls, with regard to the solubility of
its simple salts, among the erbium group&mdash;between holmium
and erbium generally&mdash;which is easily separated from the less
soluble terbium elements. The separation of yttrium, therefore,
affords an example of the combination of methods of
both kinds.</p>

<p>The methods for the separation and purification of yttrium
have recently been exhaustively examined by Meyer and
Wuorinen.<a id="FNanchor401"></a><a href="#Footnote401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> They consider the chromate method suitable only
if the terbium elements have already been removed. The
ethylsulphate method is said to be tedious, whilst the ferrocyanide
method indeed effects very rapid concentration, but with
great loss. For purposes of concentration they find the most
suitable method in the fractional hydrolysis of the phthalates;
these salts are soluble in cold water, but hydrolyse when the
solution is warmed, the most positive elements remaining of
course longest in solution. For the final purification, they
recommend fractional precipitation of the iodate from nitric
acid solution; yttrium iodate being more soluble than the
iodates of the erbium and ytterbium group, the latter collect
in the first precipitates.</p>

prepared, of which sufficiently detailed accounts have been
given in the general description of rare earth compounds. For
an exhaustive treatment, the reader is referred to Abegg’s
‘Handbuch.’</p>

<p>The <i>metal</i> has probably not been obtained in the pure

action of sodium on a mixture of the chloride with common
salt, and by electrolysis of the mixture of fused chlorides. It
is described as a greyish metal, resembling iron in appearance;
it oxidises in the air and readily decomposes boiling water.
The <i>hydroxide</i> is thrown down as a gelatinous precipitate by
alkalies; ammonia throws down basic salts, but in presence
of hydrogen peroxide an hydrated <i>peroxide</i> is obtained.
The <i>oxide</i> absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, and liberates

it melts at a relatively low temperature, 680°, and is the most

it forms a mass of brilliant white lamellæ.<a id="FNanchor404"></a><a href="#Footnote404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> It is characterised
by the ease with which it dissolves in pyridine. From aqueous

<p>The investigation of scandium, which occurs only in
extremely small quantities in the minerals employed by Nilson
and Cleve, and was therefore believed to be exceedingly rare,
was not continued until 1908, when Sir William Crookes<a id="FNanchor424"></a><a href="#Footnote424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
made a systematic investigation of a large number of minerals
in order to find a convenient source of the element. He
showed that scandium is present in many rare earth minerals,
and selected as the most suitable for the extraction of the
element a complex mineral named Wiikite, some specimens of<span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span>
which he found to contain over 1 per cent. of scandia (see <a href="#Page70">p. 70</a>).
The mineral was decomposed by fusion with potassium
hydrogen sulphate, and scandia extracted from the rare earths
by the nitrate fusion. The separation effected on these lines
was very thorough, Crookes considering a specimen of scandia
unsatisfactory if it showed any trace of the dominant ytterbium
line, 3694·344, on an over-exposed plate, or if it gave an atomic
weight for the element higher than 44·1.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A systematic investigation of the common rocks and
minerals for scandium was carried out by Eberhard in 1908,
as a result of which processes for the extraction of the oxide
from wolframite were worked out by R. J. Meyer (see <a href="#Page3">pp. 3</a>, <a href="#Page131">131</a>).
Wolframite is a tungstate of iron and manganese, containing,
in addition to other oxides, small quantities of the rare earths,
of which considerable proportions are found to be scandia.
The mineral is fused with soda in the usual way, and the rare
earths concentrated by the oxalate method. Scandium is
precipitated as the fluoride by addition of sodium silicofluoride
to the boiling acid solution, and purified by precipitation as the
double ammonium tartrate.<a id="FNanchor425"></a><a href="#Footnote425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Whilst the researches of Crookes and Eberhard have shown
how widely distributed the element really is, the minerals
which they found richest in scandium still contained extremely
small quantities of the oxide. The discovery of the mineral
Thortveitite (see <a href="#Page44">p. 44</a>), which contains about 37 per cent.
of scandia, is therefore of the greatest scientific interest, and
will doubtless allow of a very searching examination of the
properties of this interesting element.</p>

<p>Whilst the low atomic weights of scandium and yttrium
place them, to some extent, apart from the other rare earth
elements, the latter element at least is so closely allied in
properties to the other members of the group that yttria is
one of the typical oxides of the family. Scandium and its
compounds, however, present many peculiarities of behaviour
when compared with the typical members, on the grounds of
which Urbain<a id="FNanchor426"></a><a href="#Footnote426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
has contended that scandia should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
classed among the rare earths at all. Whilst this contention
is perhaps rather extreme, especially in view of the fact that
in nature scandia always occurs with other yttria oxides, it
must be admitted that in many respects the element is anomalous.
The oxide is the weakest base of the whole group, yet
the oxalate is comparatively readily soluble in mineral acids
(compare <a href="#Page132">p. 132</a>), and the potassium double sulphate is almost
insoluble in potassium sulphate. The sulphate is altogether
exceptional in that it is very easily soluble in water, and
crystallises out with 6 molecules of water of crystallisation.
The fluoride and the carbonate both dissolve readily in excess
of precipitant, whilst sodium thiosulphate precipitates a basic
salt from neutral solutions.</p>

<p id="Ref64">Meyer has pointed out the close resemblance between
beryllium and scandium. The oxide and salts are colourless;
the latter have a peculiar sweet astringent taste, and readily
yield basic salts.</p>

<p>The <i>hydroxide</i>, Sc(OH)₃, is thrown down by alkalies as a
bulky white gelatinous mass; the <i>oxide</i> is a white powder, less
readily soluble in dilute acids than most of the rare earths.
The <i>fluoride</i> is important on account of its insolubility in
mineral acids, which exceeds that of all the other rare earth
fluorides, and approaches that of thorium. It is thrown down
from neutral or acid solutions by addition of hydrofluoric
acid or a soluble fluoride; if the solution be boiled, a soluble
silicofluoride will also precipitate scandium fluoride, though
no precipitate is obtained in the cold. This behaviour is
due to the ease with which the silicofluoride is hydrolysed at
high temperatures, according to the equation:</p>

<p class="equation">Sc₂(SiF₆)₃ + 6H₂O = 2ScF₃ + 3SiO₂ + 6H₂F₂</p>

<p class="noindent">and is of great value in separating scandium from the other
earths. The fluoride is extremely resistant to acids, being
completely decomposed only by fused bisulphate. In the
absence of acids, the freshly precipitated fluoride dissolves
in excess of concentrated alkali fluoride, forming double salts;
in this behaviour, scandium resembles zirconium, but differs
from thorium and the cerium and yttrium elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span></p>

<p>The <i>chloride</i> separates from solution at ordinary temperatures
as the dodecahydrate, Sc₂Cl₆,12H₂O, which loses 9
molecules of water when kept for six hours at 100°. The
trihydrate Sc₂Cl₆,3H₂O, is converted into scandia at a red
heat, with the loss of 6 molecules of hydrogen chloride. The
<i>iodate</i>, Sc(IO₃)₃,18H₂O, is obtained as an almost insoluble
white crystalline powder by addition of ammonium iodate to a
salt in solution; hydrates with 15, 13, and 10 molecules of water
are known, and at 250° the anhydrous compound is obtained.
It resembles the iodates of the cerium and yttrium group in
being soluble in strong nitric acid, but the separation of thoria
and scandia by this method is tedious and unsatisfactory.<a id="FNanchor427"></a><a href="#Footnote427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

resemble respectively the platinocyanides of the yttrium
and of the cerium elements; in this respect, therefore, scandium
occupies an intermediate position between the two groups.</p>

<p>The <i>sulphate</i>, Sc₂(SO₄)₃, is obtained anhydrous by evaporating
the excess of acid from a solution of the oxide in the
concentrated acid, care being taken to avoid too high a
temperature. The compound dissolves very easily in water,
and slowly hydrates itself with evolution of heat; no crystals
can be obtained from the solution until it has been concentrated
to the consistency of a syrup, when on cooling it slowly deposits
the hexahydrate. This effloresces in a dry atmosphere, forming
the pentahydrate, which appears to be the most stable
hydrate at ordinary temperatures. According to Nilson, the
hexahydrate loses 4 molecules of water when maintained
at 100°. At 250° it becomes anhydrous; above that
temperature, basic salts are formed. The <i>potassium double
sulphate</i>, 3K₂SO₄,Sc₂(SO₄)₃, was shown by Nilson to resemble<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
the analogous cerium compounds in being insoluble in a
saturated solution of potassium sulphate. The <i>nitrate</i>,
Sc(NO₃)₃,4H₂O, separates from concentrated solutions over
sulphuric acid as the tetrahydrate; it is very soluble in water
and alcohol, and extremely deliquescent.</p>

<p>The <i>carbonate</i>, Sc₂(CO₃)₃,12H₂O, is thrown down by addition
of ammonium carbonate as a bulky white precipitate, easily
soluble in a hot solution of the precipitant; the solubility
in excess may be used in the separation of scandia from yttria.
Addition of water to such solutions causes separation of a
basic carbonate, but crystalline <i>double carbonates</i> may be
obtained by evaporation of concentrated solutions containing
a large excess of alkali carbonate. The sodium compound,
Sc₂(CO₃)₃,4Na₂CO₃,6H₂O, is very sparingly soluble, and has
been used in the separation from thorium. The <i>oxalate</i>,
Sc₂(C₂O₄)₃,5H₂O, differs from other oxalates of the group,
which generally separate with 10 molecules of water of crystallisation,
not only in its water content, and in its solubility
in acids, but also in the ease with which it forms double oxalates
soluble in excess of alkali oxalate; in this latter property it
shows a further resemblance to zirconium and thorium. The
<i>formate</i> and <i>acetate</i> have the formulæ Sc(OH)(HCOO)₂,H₂O
and Sc(OH)(CH₃COO)₂,2H₂O, respectively. A large number
of organic salts have been described by Sir William Crookes.<a id="FNanchor430"></a><a href="#Footnote430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

using purer material, obtained the value 44·13 by the synthetic
method. Meyer and others (<i>loc. cit.</i>) have criticised Nilson’s
estimation on the ground of his empirical method of obtaining
the neutral anhydrous sulphate. Determinations made with
material purified from thorium by the iodic acid method gave
the values 44·11, 44·11, 44·20; material purified by the double
ammonium tartrate method gave the atomic weight 43·90.
Meyer has shown that small quantities of thoria in the oxide<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
cannot be detected spectroscopically; the value of the magnetisation
coefficient, however, showed the oxide obtained by the
last method to be free from thoria, and he considers another
determination of the atomic weight to be necessary.</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XV</span><br />
THE GROUP IV<span class="smcapall">A</span> ELEMENTS&mdash;TITANIUM</h3>

<p>The oxides zirconia and thoria were generally classed among
the rare earths by the earlier chemists. This view was based
partly upon the mode of occurrence of the oxides, which are
very generally associated in nature with rare earths, and were
believed to be equally sparingly distributed, and partly on
fallacious chemical analogies. Thus Berzelius regarded thoria
as a monoxide, ThO, and classed it with the other earth
oxides, magnesia, lime, ceria, lanthana, etc., to all of which
the general formula RO was assigned. Zirconia was regarded
as a sesquioxide, Zr₂O₃, analogous to alumina, Al₂O₃, which
in turn showed many points of resemblance to the rare earths.
The introduction of the periodic classification, and a wider
knowledge of the chemical properties of the oxides, have
gradually altered the older conceptions, and zirconia and
thoria are now only classed under the head ‘Rare Earths’
when that term is used in its widest sense. More generally,
the term is restricted to the oxides of the cerium and yttrium
elements, which, whilst they cannot all be placed in Group III
of the table, yet constitute a series with properties which entitle
them to be considered in that relation.</p>

<p>The elements which fall into group IV<span class="smcapall">A</span> of Mendelejeff’s
classification are titanium, zirconium, cerium, and thorium;
the elements of lower atomic weight, carbon and silicon, are
placed by some authors in Group IV<span class="smcapall">B</span>, by others in Group IV<span class="smcapall">A</span>.
It is a feature of the periodic system that the members of the
A and B families show great differences in the end groups,
I and VII, II and VI, which disappear as the middle groups
are approached; in group IV the families A and B show only
slight differences in properties, corresponding to their amphoteric
character and electrochemical indifference, so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
elements carbon and silicon may be placed as well in the one
as in the other. Generally they are placed in family B.</p>

<p>In its tetravalent condition, titanium shows a close relationship
to silicon; the similarity is manifested by the ease with
which the dioxide replaces silica in many minerals, and the
isomorphism of many titanates with corresponding silicates.
Yet the strengthening of electropositive character, which
always accompanies the change in atomic weight in descending
a vertical column of the table, is very apparent in the case of
titanium, and its ability to form salts in the tetravalent state
is a very important property. This strengthening of the
electropositive character is still more marked in the case of the
succeeding elements. The salts of zirconium are highly hydrolysed
in solution, but they are considerably more stable than
those of tetravalent titanium; the ceric salts show the same
change, whilst thorium salts are comparatively stable in
solution, and can be recrystallised from water without change.
Zirconium hydroxide will not dissolve in alkalies, though
zirconates may be obtained in the dry way; thorium hydroxide
shows no acidic properties whatever.</p>

<p>The change in electrochemical character is accompanied
by corresponding changes in physical properties of the elements
and their compounds. With the exception of cerium, which
has a very low melting-point (623°), the elements fuse only
at high temperatures; titanium is the most refractory,
zirconium melts at over 1500°, and thorium at about 1450°.
The boiling-points of the chlorides rise as the series is
descended; titanium tetrachloride boils at 136°, zirconium
and thorium chlorides at 400°-450° and 950° respectively;
zirconium chloride partly sublimes, whilst ceric chloride decomposes
when heated.</p>

<p>The elements of Group IV<span class="smcapall">A</span> are distinguished from the
rare earth elements by their much less strongly marked electropositive
character. This is apparent not only in the amphoteric
nature of the oxides, and in the ease with which the
salts are hydrolysed in solution, but in the more pronounced
tendency to the formation of complex salts. The complex
fluorides of the type K₂RF₆ are peculiarly characteristic, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span>
in the case of titanium and zirconium have been very important
for purposes of analysis and atomic weight determination.
The solubility of zirconium and thorium salts in excess of
alkali oxalate or carbonate is also in harmony with the less
pronounced electropositive character of these elements. The
sulphates of titanium and zirconium appear to be of complex
constitution, whilst their neutral chlorides cannot be obtained
from solution. As is to be expected from its high atomic weight,
thorium approaches most nearly to the rare earths in chemical
properties; thus it forms stable double nitrates of the type
R₂Th(NO₃)₆ and its salts, especially the sulphate, resemble
those of the rare earth elements in their solubility relations.</p>

<p>The elements titanium, zirconium, and thorium are distinguished
also by the fact that they form no definite hydroxides.
The precipitates thrown down from solutions of the salts, on
addition of alkali, are hydrated oxides, which lose water continuously
when dried, giving rise to no definite chemical individuals
until constant weight is reached with the anhydrous oxides.
The hydroxides have the further characteristic, common also
to the other members of Group IV, of readily forming colloidal
solutions and gels, a property possessed to some extent also by
the elements themselves, and particularly by zirconium, which,
when reduced from its compounds, shows a great tendency to go
into colloidal solution merely on washing. Highly characteristic
also is the property of forming ‘meta’-oxides (acids)
and ‘meta’-salts, which is common to all the Group IV elements
which have solid oxides.</p>

<p>In presence of hydrogen peroxide, alkalies throw down
characteristic hydrated peroxides, which have definite acidic
properties in the case of titanium: the zirconium compound
is less strongly acidic, the cerium compound shows no tendency
to salt formation, whilst if hydrogen peroxide be added to a
neutral or faintly acid solution of a thorium salt, the precipitate
is a peroxy-salt, containing some acid grouping, <i>e.g.</i> SO₄,NO₃.</p>

<p>With regard to valency, the elements in the typical compounds
are tetravalent. Titanium forms three series of
salts, in which the element is respectively di-, tri-, and tetravalent;
salts of the first two series have powerful reducing<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
properties, and the compounds in which the metal is tetravalent
are most stable. Zirconium is always, with the doubtful
exception of its peroxy-compounds and the lower oxides,
tetravalent. Cerium, as already described, can form two
series of compounds, in which it is respectively tri- and tetravalent;
thorium, like zirconium, is always tetravalent.</p>

<h4><b>Titanium</b>, Ti = 48·1</h4>

<p>Though generally classed among the rare elements, titanium
is probably at least as widely distributed in nature as most
of the common metals. It occurs as the dioxide in small
quantities in all the common silicate rocks and minerals,
and in traces in the animal and vegetable kingdoms; the
element has been identified in the sun and in many stars,
and has been found in meteorites. Probably the commonest
mineral in which the element occurs in quantity is ilmenite,
or titaniferous ironstone, which occurs in enormous quantities
in many parts of the world (see <a href="#Page57">p. 57</a>). The pure dioxide
occurs in the three forms <a href="#Ref46">Rutile</a>, <a href="#Ref48">Brookite</a>, and <a href="#Ref47">Anatase</a> (<i>q.v.</i>),
in which it is said to be isotrimorphous with tin dioxide.
Other important titanium minerals are Perovskite, Titanite
or Sphene, the Euxenite series, and other minerals of the
tantalo-columbate group (see <a href="#Page1">Part I</a>).</p>

<p>The commercial sources of titanium compounds are the
minerals rutile and ilmenite. These may be opened up
by fusion with alkali or alkali carbonate; the residue after
extraction with water is dissolved in acid, and precipitated
with ammonia; the mixture of iron and titanium oxides thrown
down may be separated by one of the methods outlined on
<a href="#Page339">p. 339</a>. Fusion with potassium bisulphate has also been
employed. A very satisfactory method is that of Stähler,<a id="FNanchor437"></a><a href="#Footnote437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
in which the ore is fused with carbon in the electric furnace.
The carbides so obtained are heated in a stream of chlorine,
when the volatile titanium tetrachloride distils over, and
may be obtained quite pure by redistillation; by appropriate
methods, the required compounds may be obtained
from this. (See also <a href="#Page326">pp. 326-7</a>.)</p>

<p><i>The Metal.</i>&mdash;The difficulty of isolating metallic titanium
in the pure state is very great, on account of its great affinity
for nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, etc., the ease with
which it forms alloys with all the common metals, and the
extremely high melting-point; in consequence, it is only
within recent times that the element has been obtained in a
state approximately approaching purity, and the accounts
given of its physical properties vary very widely.</p>

<p>Berzelius prepared an impure titanium (Ti = 86 per cent.)
by reduction of potassium titanofluoride with potassium;
the method was modified by Wöhler, who heated a tube containing
two boats, of which one was filled with the fluoride,
the other with sodium, reduction being effected by the sodium
vapour. Many authors have attempted the reduction of
titanium tetrachloride by means of hydrogen. By heating
the tetrachloride with sodium in a cast iron bomb, Nilson and
Pettersson obtained a product containing 95 per cent. of the
element. Reduction of the dioxide by means of sodium,
magnesium, silicon, or aluminium has not been found to yield
good results, by reason of the ease with which titanium alloys
with these elements. Reduction of the dioxide with carbon
yields good results only when precautions are taken to avoid
the formation of the compound which the element so readily
forms with carbon and nitrogen. Moissan<a id="FNanchor438"></a><a href="#Footnote438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> found that if temperatures
high enough to decompose this compound were used,
the product contained as the only impurity carbon, which could
be partly removed by fusing with the dioxide; the product
then contained 98 per cent. of titanium.</p>

<p>The element has been obtained in the fused condition by
Weiss and Kayser,<a id="FNanchor439"></a><a href="#Footnote439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> who pressed the amorphous form into
sticks, under a pressure of 70,000 atmospheres, and employed
these as pencils for the electric arc <i>in vacuo</i>; the metal fused,
forming globules on the ends of the electrodes, which were
detached after the apparatus had been allowed to cool.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The amorphous element is a dark powder, resembling
finely divided iron (Ferrum reductum), of density 3·5-3·6.<span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span>
The specific heat rises rapidly with the temperature, so that
the atomic heat has the values 5·40 between 0° and 100°, 6·18
between 0° and 210°, 7·13 between 0° and 300°, and 7·77
between 0° and 440°. The amorphous element is said to be
paramagnetic.</p>

<p>The fused carbonaceous product of Moissan formed an
extremely brittle mass, with a shining white lustre on the
fractured surface, sufficiently hard to scratch quartz and
steel; its density was determined as 4·87. The product
of Weiss and Kayser was also extremely hard and brittle;
when rubbed against steel, it gave bright sparks. Its density
was found to be 5·174, and the heat of combustion for the
gram-atom, 97·79 K.</p>

<p>The amorphous variety is fairly stable in air, but burns
vigorously when heated in air, oxygen, or halogens. Heated
in nitrogen or ammonia, it reacts vigorously, forming the
nitride TiN; if carbon is present, a peculiar substance of
uncertain composition, known as <i>titanium cyanonitride</i>, is
formed. This substance is also obtained when air is passed
over a heated mixture of the dioxide with coke, and is found
in blast-furnaces in which ores containing small quantities
of titanium are worked; it forms brilliant red cubes, which
are extremely hard and resistant to acids. This substance,
as well as the nitride itself, yields ammonia when heated
in steam, and has been proposed as a medium for ‘fixing’
atmospheric nitrogen (see <a href="#Page337">p. 337</a>).</p>

<p>The amorphous element also absorbs hydrogen, when
heated in the gas, but no definite hydride is known. It combines
when heated with almost all the known non-metals,
and forms alloys with all the common metals. Moissan<a id="FNanchor440"></a><a href="#Footnote440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
claims to have prepared a compound as hard as diamond by
heating titanium with boron in the electric furnace. The
element attacks steam at a red heat.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The element is fairly resistant to acids in the cold, but
is readily attacked, with evolution of hydrogen, on warming.
Hot dilute hydrochloric acid gives the trichloride; but dilute
sulphuric acid is variously reported to give the di- and<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
tri-salt. Hot nitric acid oxidises it readily, forming the so-called
metatitanic acid. Hydrofluoric acid attacks it very
readily, forming the tetrafluoride.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Compounds of Divalent Titanium.</span></h5>

<p>The compounds of divalent titanium show resemblances
to those of divalent iron, chromium and vanadium, but on
account of the great difficulty of preparing them and protecting
them from oxidation, little is known of their properties and
behaviour; even the colour of the salts in solution is not
known with certainty. In its divalent state; the element does
not appear to act as a strongly positive metal; the salts
in solution are said to show an acid reaction, whilst the precipitates
thrown down with alkali oxalates and acetates are
soluble in excess of the precipitant, forming deeply coloured
solutions. With sodium phosphate the soluble salts give a bluish-black
precipitate, with potassium ferrocyanide and ferricyanide,
dark brown and reddish-brown precipitates respectively. They
are distinguished from salts of the higher oxides of titanium
by the brown colouration produced by potassium thiocyanate
in presence of hydrochloric acid.<a id="FNanchor441"></a><a href="#Footnote441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>The <i>hydroxide</i> is thrown down from solutions by addition of
alkali, alkali carbonate, alkali cyanide, or ammonium sulphide,
as a black precipitate. It cannot be transformed to the
corresponding oxide by drying, since it attacks the water
with evolution of hydrogen, forming the dioxide. The <i>monoxide</i>,
TiO, has probably never been obtained in the pure state;
it is formed by reduction of the dioxide with zinc or magnesium.
Moissan<a id="FNanchor442"></a><a href="#Footnote442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> obtained it in the form of black prismatic crystals
by treating the dioxide with the calculated amount of charcoal
in the electric furnace. The <i>sulphide</i>, TiS, is an extremely
stable compound; it can be prepared by heating the higher
sulphides in a stream of hydrogen to a very high temperature,
and then forms pseudomorphs after these.<a id="FNanchor443"></a><a href="#Footnote443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> It is a dark red
metallic mass, which reacts in the air only when heated, forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span>

<p>The <i>dichloride</i>, TiCl₂, is obtained in the impure state as a
black powder by decomposition of the trichloride at a red heat:
the tetrachloride is formed at the same time, and volatilises.<a id="FNanchor444"></a><a href="#Footnote444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
According to v. d. Pfordten,<a id="FNanchor445"></a><a href="#Footnote445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> it is obtained by reduction of the
tetrachloride by sulphuretted hydrogen or sodium amalgam
in the cold. The latter author states that it dissolves in alcohol
or water in absence of air to a dark brown solution; Friedel
and Guérin, however, state that it acts energetically on these
solvents with evolution of hydrogen, forming a yellow solution.
When heated in the air it burns, evolving fumes of the
tetrachloride and leaving a residue of the dioxide. The <i>iodide</i>,
TiI₂, has been obtained by Defacq and Copaux<a id="FNanchor446"></a><a href="#Footnote446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> by reduction
of the tetraiodide with silver or mercury, as a black, lustrous,
infusible sublimate. It is insoluble in organic solvents, but
reacts with water and aqueous alkalies, and is readily attacked
by acids. Hydrogen at a bright red heat reduces it to
amorphous titanium.</p>

Compounds of trivalent titanium are frequently referred to in English
chemical and technical literature as ‘Titanous Compounds,’ the salts of the
tetravalent element being tacitly recognised as ‘Titanic Compounds.’ In
view of the existence of compounds of divalent titanium, to which the name
‘Titanous Compounds’ might be more logically applied, the former nomenclature
cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory, and it is therefore not
adopted here.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>These salts are obtained when the element is dissolved
in hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, and by reduction of the
compounds of tetravalent titanium in solution by means of
zinc and hydrochloric acid, or by electrolysis. According to
Diethelm and Forster<a id="FNanchor448"></a><a href="#Footnote448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> the reduction may also be effected by
hydrogen in presence of finely divided platinum. The salts
have strong reducing properties, transforming nitro-bodies to
amines and decolourising azo-derivatives very rapidly; they
reduce unsaturated bodies, and reduce dyes to the leuco-bases;
they reduce sulphurous acid to sulphur, precipitate gold, silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
and mercury from their salts, and reduce cupric and ferric
salts to cuprous and ferrous compounds respectively. The
salts are green or violet in solution, showing the phenomenon
of hydrate-isomerism which is exhibited by the chromic salts;
they are to some extent hydrolysed in aqueous solution, as
shown by the acid reaction of the chloride. They resemble
the salts of ferric iron and aluminium in giving precipitates of
basic salts when boiled with sodium acetate or sodium formate,
and in giving no precipitate with alkalies in the presence of
organic hydroxy-acids. Ferrocyanide and ferricyanide give
brown precipitates.</p>

been prepared by Friedel and Guérin<a id="FNanchor449"></a><a href="#Footnote449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> by heating the dioxide
to a white heat in a current of hydrogen and titanium tetrachloride;
it forms black lustrous crystals, isomorphous with
hæmatite. The <i>sulphide</i>, Ti₂S₃, is best obtained by reduction
of the disulphide, at a moderate temperature, in a stream of
hydrogen or nitrogen, but is also prepared by the action of
a mixture of carbon disulphide and sulphuretted hydrogen on
the dioxide at a high temperature. It is a dark grey metallic
powder, stable towards air, water, alkalies and dilute acids.</p>

<p><i>Titanium Nitride</i>, TiN, is obtained in all reduction processes
in which titanium compounds are used, if air or nitrogen is
admitted; it is formed when the element is heated in nitrogen,
and by the action of ammonia on the chloride. It forms lustrous,
bronze-coloured leaflets, which appear blue or violet when
powdered. It is extremely hard, and very stable, but is
attacked by alkalies with evolution of ammonia. It reduces
the oxides of copper and lead in the fused state. Ruff and
Eisner have shown that it is a true nitride of the trivalent
element, and that only one nitride exists.<a id="FNanchor450"></a><a href="#Footnote450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>The <i>fluoride</i>, TiF₃, has been obtained as an insoluble violet
powder by reduction of potassium titanofluoride, K₂TiF₆, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
hydrogen. From a solution it may be obtained by reduction
of the same salt with zinc and hydrochloric acid, or sodium
amalgam. It forms complex salts with alkali or ammonium
fluoride, of which the compound (NH₄)₃TiF₆ is an example;
this salt appears to be isomorphous with the analogous
compounds, (NH₄)₃VF₆, (NH₄)₃CrF₆, and (NH₄)₃FeF₆. By
autoxidation in the air, the solutions form fluoroxypertitanates.
The complex salts appear to exist in two forms,
a violet insoluble form and a green soluble modification.</p>

<p>The <i>chloride</i>, TiCl₃, is obtained anhydrous by reduction of
the tetrachloride&mdash;mercury, silver, and hydrogen being the most
suitable agents. Heated in hydrogen, it breaks up, forming
the tetrachloride and the dichloride; heated in air it burns,
evolving the tetrachloride and leaving a residue of dioxide.
In solution, in combination with alkali chlorides, and as the
solid hydrate, it exists in the green and violet forms. Concentrated
aqueous solutions deposit the violet hexahydrate,
TiCl₃,6H₂O. If such a solution be covered with ether, and
saturated at 0° with hydrogen chloride, the green modification
is formed, and may be extracted by the ether; it is stable only
in the presence of hydrochloric acid. In the violet form, all the
chlorine is in the ionic condition, and can be removed by silver
nitrate; similar determinations have not been made with the
green form, but it is most probable, as in the case of the analogous
chromic salts, that only part of the chlorine content can
be removed by silver nitrate. Böck and Moser<a id="FNanchor451"></a><a href="#Footnote451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> have recently
described a brown substance, obtained by the action of the
silent electric discharge on a mixture of hydrogen and the vapour
of titanium tetrachloride at the ordinary temperature, which
they believe to be a monotropic modification of the ordinary
violet trichloride; the change of this brown form to the violet
form is irreversible.</p>

<p>For estimation of ferric salts, an aliquot quantity is titrated
directly with the titanium solution, ammonium thiocyanate
being used as indicator. Ferrous salts and ferric salts in the
same solution are easily estimated by titrating the former
with permanganate solution, or better with hydrogen peroxide,
and then estimating the total ferric salt with the titanium
solution. Oxidising agents like nitrates and chlorates can be
estimated in acid solution by treatment with an excess of a
ferrous salt, and estimation of the ferric compound formed by
means of titanium. Azo-bodies and organic dyes can be titrated
directly, if soluble in hydrochloric acid, the disappearance
of colour marking the end of the reaction; nitroso-compounds
can also be estimated in this way. If the compound is<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>

with excess of the titanium salt, and the excess then determined
by means of ferric iron. Insoluble dyes may also be
converted into soluble sulphonic acids, and estimated directly
in solution. Ammonium persulphate may be estimated by
reduction with excess of the chloride, and back titration of the
excess with ferric iron. Hydrogen peroxide may be estimated
directly, the disappearance of the yellow colour formed at
the first addition marking the end of the reaction. Tin may
be estimated by addition of an excess of a ferric salt, and
estimation of the excess by titanium in the usual way. Cupric

<h5><span class="smcap">Compounds of Tetravalent Titanium</span></h5>

<p>The compounds of tetravalent titanium are much more
stable than the compounds in which the element has a lower
valency, and are very readily formed from them. The dioxide
is amphoteric in character, and acts as a weak acid as
well as a weak base; the salts it forms with acids as well
as those it forms with bases are very easily hydrolysed, with
separation of the hydrated oxide. Titanium salts, therefore,
can only be held in solution by a considerable excess of
acid. The tendency to the formation of complex compounds
is very pronounced, particularly in the case of the fluoride,
oxalate and tartrate.</p>

<p>The <i>hydroxide</i>, or <i>hydrated oxide</i>, is capable of existing in
two modifications, according to the conditions under which
it is thrown down, though the two can hardly be said to be
very definitely differentiated. The α or ortho form is obtained
as a voluminous white precipitate by the addition of ammonia
or alkali hydroxide in the cold to a freshly prepared solution
of a titanium salt. It is insoluble in water and alcohol, but
dissolves readily in dilute mineral acids, and to some extent
also in dilute alkalies. The water content is very variable,
and no definite hydrate or hydroxide can be prepared; when
the substance is heated, it loses water continuously, and at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
definite temperature glows, doubtless by reason of some
polymeric change. If it be maintained for some time at a
temperature somewhat below the normal temperature of
glowing, this phenomenon no longer occurs when the
temperature is further raised.</p>

<p>The β modification, or metatitanic acid, as it is called,
is obtained by hydrolysis of the salts by boiling, or by addition
of alkali at 100°, as a fine white precipitate. It is almost
insoluble in dilute acids and alkalies, but dissolves in water
to a colloidal solution; when heated it does not glow. The
β form is also obtained when the metatitanates are treated
with water; these compounds hydrolyse very readily, but
the precipitated dioxide carries down alkali by adsorption.</p>

<p>The <i>dioxide</i>, TiO₂, occurs crystalline in nature in the three
forms Rutile, Brookite, and Anatase, all of which can be
prepared by laboratory methods;<a id="FNanchor454"></a><a href="#Footnote454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> the amorphous form is
obtained by ignition of the hydrated oxide, and of suitable
salts. The oxide melts at 1560°, forming a mobile (?) liquid
of density 4·1; for the physical properties, see the accounts
of the naturally occurring forms in <a href="#Page72">Chapter V</a>. When heated
in a current of hydrogen or carbon monoxide, it gives rise
to intermediate oxides, Ti₃O₄, Ti₇O₁₂, etc., which are not very
well known, and are of doubtful individuality. It reacts
when heated in chlorine, and with many non-metallic chlorides,
forming the tetrachloride; with carbon disulphide at high
temperatures it gives the disulphide, ammonia at a red heat
forms the nitride. It is exceedingly resistant to acids, but
is attacked slowly by boiling sulphuric acid, more quickly
by fused bisulphate.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><i>Titanium disulphide</i>, TiS₂, is obtained in the pure state
when a mixture of the vapour of the tetrachloride and sulphuretted
hydrogen is led through a strongly heated porcelain
tube. It is a fairly stable substance, forming metallic crystals
which yield the dioxide when heated in air. When heated
in a stream of hydrogen or nitrogen it yields one or other
of the lower sulphides according to the temperature employed.
It is not attacked by water, but dissolves in acids, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
decomposed by boiling potash, forming a titanate; it is
insoluble in alkali sulphides.</p>

<p>The <i>carbide</i>, TiC, was prepared by Moissan by heating the
oxide with carbon in the electric furnace; any excess of carbon
separates on cooling as graphite. It has the density 4·25, and
resembles the fused element in appearance. It dissolves in
nitric but not in hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><i>Titanium tetrafluoride</i>, TiF₄, is obtained by the action
of fluorine on the element or the carbide, and by the action
of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid on the element or the tetrachloride.
It is a white powder, and boils at 284°; it is
very hygroscopic, and dissolves easily in alcohol and water,
showing little tendency to form basic salts. From the concentrated
aqueous solution it separates as the dihydrate,
TiF₄,2H₂O; basic salts are obtained only by repeated evaporation
with water. The anhydrous compound forms additive
products with ammonia and with pyridine.</p>

<p>With aqueous hydrofluoric acid it forms the complex
H₂TiF₆, as shown by conductivity measurements, and the
fact that only a slow and incomplete precipitation of the
hydroxide is effected by addition of ammonia. The solution
dissolves metallic oxides and carbonates, forming <i>titanofluorides</i>,
which are for the most part isomorphous with the
corresponding silicofluorides, stannofluorides, and zirconofluorides.
They are very stable crystalline salts, of the general
formula R´₂TiF₆; many salts of the types R´´TiF₆, R´₃TiF₇, etc.,
have been prepared. The most important is the potassium
salt, K₂TiF₆, which crystallises from acid solutions in monoclinic
tablets; from aqueous solution it separates as the
monohydrate, K₂TiF₆,H₂O, isomorphous with the compounds
K₂CbOF₅,H₂O and K₂WO₂F₄,H₂O. The hydrate loses its
water at 100°, and melts at a white heat without decomposition.
It is moderately soluble in hot, very sparingly soluble in cold
water, and hence is readily recrystallised.</p>

<p>The <i>tetrachloride</i>, TiCl₄, is important, on account of its
low boiling-point, for the separation and purification of titanium
compounds. In physical as well as chemical properties,
it resembles the chloride of a non-metallic element rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span>
than a normal salt, and is distinguished by the ease with
which it combines or reacts with the most widely differing
organic compounds. It is prepared by the action of chlorine
upon the element, the carbide, or a mixture of the dioxide
with carbon, and by the action of chloroform or carbon tetrachloride
upon the dioxide at a bright red heat. It is a colourless,
transparent liquid, of density 1·76 at 0°; it freezes at -23°,
and boils at 136° under atmospheric pressure. In moist air
it fumes excessively, yielding hydrogen chloride by hydrolysis:
TiCl₄ + H₂O = TiOCl₂ + 2HCl, and is decomposed by water
with separation of the hydrated oxide. If the compound
be added slowly to a large quantity of cold water, and the
clear solution warmed, the oxide formed by hydrolysis remains
in colloidal solution.</p>

<p>The chloride dissolves in fuming hydrochloric acid, forming
a deep yellow solution, which becomes colourless when diluted.
The solution appears to contain the unstable complex acid
H₂TiCl₆, or its ions; by addition of ammonia, or organic bases,
salts of the type (NH₄)₂TiCl₆ can be obtained as yellow crystalline
solids. An interesting property of the chloride is its
ability to form stable additive compounds with the chlorides
of negative elements. A long series of these are known, of
which the compounds TiCl₄,PCl₃, TiCl₄,PCl₅, TiCl₄,POCl₃,
and TiCl₄,2POCl₃ may be considered examples; for the most
part, they can be distilled without decomposition. A very
long series of compounds, partly additive and partly condensation
products, with all kinds of organic substances, is
also known.</p>

<p>A series of <i>oxychlorides</i>, or <i>basic chlorides</i>, TiCl₃(OH),
TiCl₂(OH)₂, and TiCl(OH)₃, has been obtained by addition
of hydrochloric acid, in certain quantities and concentrations,
to the chloride; they are amorphous solids, of which little is
known.</p>

<p>The <i>tetrabromide</i>, TiBr₄, is a yellow crystalline solid, melting
at 39° and boiling at 230°. Its solutions in concentrated
hydrobromic acid are of a blood-red colour, and by treatment
with ammonia and organic bases yield deep red crystalline
salts of the type (NH₄)₂TiBr₆. The <i>tetraiodide</i>, TiI₄, is a reddish-brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
metallic-looking solid, melting at 150°, and boiling at
360°; no complex salts are known.</p>

<p><i>The sulphates.</i>&mdash;Many compounds of doubtful composition
and individuality have been described as titanium sulphates,
but relatively little is known with certainty of this class of derivatives.
The most stable seems to be the <i>titanyl sulphate</i>,
TiOSO₄, obtained as a white powder, which is slowly hydrolysed
by water, by evaporating a solution of the dioxide in concentrated
sulphuric acid. Under suitable conditions, <i>e.g.</i> when
separated from acid or alcoholic solutions, it is said to form
hydrated compounds; the mono-, di- and penta-hydrate
have been described. When solutions of this compound in
concentrated sulphuric acid are treated with concentrated
aqueous solutions of alkali sulphates, salts of the formulæ
(NH₄)₂TiO(SO₄)₂,H₂O and K₄(TiO)₃(SO₄)₅,10H₂O, are obtained.
By treating solutions of the dioxide in a large excess
of concentrated acid with solutions of calcium or strontium
sulphate in sulphuric acid, salts of the type R´´Ti(SO₄)₃ are
obtained; the barium salt has the formula 3Ti(SO₄)₂,2BaSO₄.
All these compounds are rapidly hydrolysed by water.</p>

<p><i>Phosphoric Acid Derivatives.</i>&mdash;Solutions of titanium compounds
are completely precipitated by the addition of phosphoric
acid, or soluble phosphates, even in presence of a large excess
of mineral acid, but the composition of the precipitate obtained
is unknown. By heating the oxide with orthophosphoric acid,
a crystalline compound, TiO₂,P₂O₅, is obtained, and various
alkali double phosphates may be prepared by suitable fusions.</p>

<p>Concentrated aqueous oxalic acid solutions readily dissolve
one equivalent of titanium dioxide, forming greenish-yellow
solutions which contain <i>titanyl oxalate</i>, TiO(C₂O₄). From
alcoholic solution, this substance can be precipitated by ether
as the alcoholate, TiO(C₂O₄),C₂H₅OH, a micro-crystalline
precipitate soluble in water and alcohol. <i>Titanyloxalic acid</i>,
TiO(HC₂O₄)₂,H₂O, and its salts are stable compounds; the
latter are obtained by dissolving the dioxide in alkali binoxalate,
the acid itself being obtained by treatment of the sparingly
soluble barium salt with sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Complex acids are also formed with tartaric acid, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
other organic hydroxy-acids; from its solutions in these acids,
the dioxide cannot be again precipitated by boiling, or by
addition of alkalies.</p>

<p><i>Titanates and Pertitanates.</i>&mdash;On account of the weakly
acid character of the dioxide, stable titanates can be prepared
only in the dry way. The dioxide resembles silica in the
conditions under which it forms salts, and in the nature, and
generally the crystallographic properties, of the products
obtained. The commonest salts are the metatitanates of the
formulae R´₂TiO₃ and R´´TiO₃, which are obtained by fusing
the dioxide with metallic oxides and carbonates, sometimes
with addition of a suitable agent to act as a crystallising
medium, <i>e.g.</i> sodium tungstate, calcium chloride, magnesium
chloride, etc. Calcium metatitanate, CaTiO₃, prepared by
heating titanium dioxide with calcium carbonate in presence
of calcium chloride, is identical in properties with the naturally
occurring compound, <a href="#Ref78">Perovskite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>). Orthotitanates of
divalent metals only are known; these have the general
formula R´´₂TiO₄, and are prepared by similar methods. The
iron compound FeTiO₃ is also identical in properties with
the mineral ilmenite, and isomorphous with the sesquioxides
Fe₂O₃, Ti₂O₃. Magnesium titanates of both the ortho type
(Mg₂TiO₄) and the meta type (MgTiO₃) have been prepared
in the laboratory; the latter is identical with the mineral
<a href="#Ref79">Geikielite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The compounds prepared in this way are all insoluble in
water, doubtless by reason of the slowness with which such
compact solids can be attacked; they dissolve easily in dilute
acids. The weakly acid character of titanium dioxide is
shown by the fact that if the fusion with metallic carbonates
be carried out in vessels so adjusted that the carbon dioxide
exerts a pressure of one atmosphere, a condition of equilibrium
is reached, in which a considerable part of the carbonate
remains unattacked. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide,
however, the acidic properties are considerably strengthened,
and the per-salts can be obtained in the wet way.</p>

<p>Addition of hydrogen peroxide to a neutral or acid solution
of a titanium compound gives a yellow colour, due to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
formation of a peroxide, TiO₃,aq. Such solutions have the
same oxidising powers as hydrogen peroxide, but do not give
the blue colouration with chromium salts. By treatment of
the solution with dilute alkalies, an hydrated peroxide is
thrown down, which, when dried over phosphoric anhydride,
has the formula TiO₃,3H₂O, and forms a yellow, horny mass.
The freshly precipitated peroxide dissolves in acids and
alkalies; from the latter solutions, by addition of hydrogen
peroxide and alcohol, pertitanates of various composition
can be obtained, of which the following are examples&nbsp;:
Na₂O₂,TiO₃,3H₂O; (NH₄)₂O₂,TiO₃,H₂O₂; BaO₂,TiO₃,5H₂O;
K₂O₄,K₂O₂,TiO₃,10H₂O, etc. These salts lose hydrogen peroxide
when treated with dilute acids, and their constitutions
are unknown.</p>

<p>An interesting series of fluoroxypertitanates has been
prepared by oxidation of the solution of titanium dioxide in
hydrofluoric acid with hydrogen peroxide, and addition of
metallic fluorides. The ammonium compound, (NH₄)₃TiO₂F₅,
crystallises in yellow octahedra, isomorphous with the salts
ZrF₄,3NH₄F and CbOF₃,3NH₄F. The potassium salt, K₂TiO₂F₄,
crystallises well from water, and is easily obtained in the
pure state; various barium salts are known. Similar
compounds with oxalic acid have also been prepared.</p>

<h6 class="inline"><b>Atomic Weight of Titanium.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The first reliable determinations
of this constant were carried out by H. Rose in 1829.
He determined the ratio TiCl₄&nbsp;: 4AgCl, by dissolving the pure
tetrachloride, weighed in sealed glass bulbs, in water in closed
flasks, precipitating the dioxide by ammonia, and weighing
the silver chloride obtained by adding silver nitrate to the
filtered and acidified solution. He obtained the values 48·27
and 48·13, which agree very well with the accepted value,
48·1. In the same year, Mosander, using a method not specified,
obtained the value 47·15. Determinations carried out by
Pierre (1847) and Demoly (1849) led to widely varying results.
A series of determinations carried out by Thorpe during the
years 1883-1885 gave consistent results. The method used
was the precipitation of silver halide from the tetrachloride
and tetrabromide, and the mean value of seven series of determinations<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
gave the number 48·08. The International Committee
have adopted this result as the basis of the accepted
value, 48·1.</p>

<div class="details special">

<p class="clearboth">&nbsp;</p>

<h6 class="inline detailsspecial"><b>Detection.</b></h6>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The specific reactions for the element are
frequently masked by the presence of other metals,
especially of iron, columbium, tantalum, and vanadium,
which most frequently accompany it in nature, and
from which a quantitative separation is frequently
very difficult (see <a href="#Page338">p. 338</a>). The most characteristic
reactions are the following:</p>

<p class="tireaction">(1) Reduction in acid solution by means of tin or
zinc gives an intense violet colour, due to the
formation of trivalent titanium salts. Various
colours are given by vanadium, columbium, and
tungsten, so that the test is not decisive if these
are present.</p>

<p class="tireaction">(2) Hydrogen peroxide in acid solution gives a
reddish-yellow colour, which is very delicate, and
is used in quantitative estimation; vanadium
compounds interfere.</p>

<p class="tireaction">(3) In sulphuric acid solution, characteristic colours
are obtained with many phenolic compounds;
thymol gives a blood-red colour which is
exceedingly intense.</p>

<p class="tireaction">(4) A very characteristic and intense colour is

THE GROUP IV<span class="smcapall">A</span> ELEMENTS (<i>continued</i>)&mdash;ZIRCONIUM
AND THORIUM</h3>

<h4><b>Zirconium</b>, Zr = 90·6</h4>

<p>The oxide zirconia was isolated as a new earth from zircon
from Ceylon by Klaproth in 1789; six years later the new
earth was obtained also from hyacinth, the gem-variety of
the same mineral. The new oxide was examined in 1818 by
Berzelius, who pointed out its resemblance to alumina, and
gave it the formula Zr₂O₃; during the next two decades he
thoroughly investigated its properties, preparing the element
itself, and determining its equivalent. In 1857 a determination
of the vapour density of the chloride, by Deville and
Troost, showed that the element is really tetravalent, and
that the formula ZrO₂ must be assigned to the oxide; this
formula was shown to accord with the isomorphism of rutile
(TiO₂) and zircon (ZrO₂,SiO₂) by Rose in 1859, whilst in the
following year Marignac observed the isomorphism between
the fluozirconates of zinc and nickel and the fluosilicates,
fluotitanates, and fluostannates of these metals. The homogeneity
of the oxide has been questioned; Svanberg in 1845
considered it to be a mixture of at least three earths, whilst
Sorby and Forbes in 1869 claimed to have discovered in it
a new oxide, ‘Jargonia.’ These claims, however, have been
shown to have been founded on inaccurate experimental work,
and the individuality of the element is at the present time
considered to be well established.</p>

<p>Zirconium is fairly widely distributed in nature, but
generally in very small quantities, and can be rightly classed<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
as one of the rarer elements. It occurs in some silicates,
and in small quantities in almost all the rare earth minerals.
The most important source of the element and its compounds
was until quite recently the mineral Zircon, with its gem-varieties
Hyacinth and Jargon, and the large number of
secondary altered zircon minerals. Since its discovery in
1892, however, the naturally occurring oxide, Baddeleyite,<a id="FNanchor455"></a><a href="#Footnote455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
has become increasingly important for the extraction of
zirconium compounds, especially for the preparation of the
pure oxide for fire-resistant materials.</p>

<p>The minerals may be treated by any of the usual methods.
Zircon may be fused with alkali or alkali carbonate; the
cooled melt is extracted with water, and the insoluble alkali
zirconate decomposed by dilute acids; from the solution,
zirconia is thrown down by alkalies. Potassium hydrogen
fluoride and potassium hydrogen sulphate may be used for
the treatment either of zircon or of baddeleyite; in the first
case, the potassium fluozirconate formed may be dissolved
by boiling with dilute hydrofluoric acid, and separates out
readily on cooling, whilst the fluosilicate formed is not dissolved;
the second treatment yields the sulphate, which may
also be dissolved out by dilute acid. A very convenient method
consists in reducing with carbon, either alone or in presence
of lime, at the temperature of the electric arc; the infusible
zirconium carbide is formed, whilst silica, if present, is reduced
to the carbide, which is volatile at that temperature and is
therefore driven off. The zirconium carbide may be dissolved
in warm aqua regia.</p>

<p>In all these methods the compounds obtained are contaminated
with iron, which clings to zirconium very tenaciously.
Many methods have been devised for its removal. A very
suitable method is the thiosulphate precipitation. Zirconia
is thrown down quantitatively, mixed with sulphur, from a not
too strongly acid solution by addition of sodium thiosulphate
at the boiling-point, sulphur dioxide being at the same time
evolved, by decomposition of the potential thiosulphuric acid<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
formed by hydrolysis. Thorium and titanium accompany the
zirconium, but iron, aluminium, and the rare earths remain
in solution. Another method depends on the fact that zirconium
is not precipitated from alkaline solution by ammonium
sulphide in the presence of tartaric acid, whereas this reagent
does not inhibit the precipitation of ferrous sulphide. Iron
may also be removed from a solution in concentrated hydrochloric
acid by means of ether, in which medium ferric chloride
is easily soluble. Zirconium compounds may be obtained free
from iron by repeated crystallisations of the oxychloride.</p>

<p>Zirconium forms only one series of compounds, in which
the metal is tetravalent. Its chemical behaviour accords
well with its position in the periodic classification. It is
somewhat more electropositive than titanium, as shown by
the fact that the hydroxide will not dissolve in alkalies, though
zirconates may be obtained by the fusion methods; the oxide,
however, is still a weak base, and the salts are to a large extent
hydrolysed in solution. The formation of a stable oxychloride,
which can be recrystallised without change in composition,
shows clearly the strengthening of the electropositive character.
It has still, however, in a high degree, the property of forming
complex salts, which is characteristic of the less electropositive
metals.</p>

<p>The group relations are borne out by the isomorphism of
many related salts. The hydroxide and oxide show polymeric
modifications, and the former has the usual tendency of compounds
of this group to form colloidal solutions, a tendency
which extends to the element itself. The metal resembles
titanium in the eagerness with which it combines with other
elements, especially with oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, whilst
the chloride closely resembles titanium tetrachloride in general
properties, and in the ease with which it forms addition and
condensation products with other substances.</p>

<p><i>The Metal.</i>&mdash;All the difficulties which attend the attempts
to prepare metallic titanium in the pure state have to be
encountered in the preparation of metallic zirconium. The
attempts which have been made have used the same methods,
and obtained much the same kind of result as those employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
in the case of titanium.<a id="FNanchor456"></a><a href="#Footnote456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The reduction of potassium fluozirconate
by metallic potassium, first employed by Berzelius,
gives an amorphous product of unknown metal-content; it
certainly contains a considerable percentage of oxygen. The
monoxide is obtained when zirconia is reduced by magnesium
(Winkler’s method). The reduction of the fluozirconates of
potassium by means of sodium gives better results if the reaction
is carried out in presence of sodium chloride in a sealed
iron bomb; the product after careful washing contains 97-98
per cent. of the metal. Reduction with aluminium leads
to the formation of alloys; Weiss and Neumann<a id="FNanchor457"></a><a href="#Footnote457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> have used
these in the form of pencils as electrodes between which they
pass the electric arc <i>in vacuo</i>, and so obtain an almost pure
zirconium. The 97-98 per cent. amorphous product obtained
by the sodium reduction also yields the practically pure metal
when treated in this way (compare Titanium, <a href="#Page223">p. 223</a>). A
very pure zirconium has been obtained by Wedekind<a id="FNanchor458"></a><a href="#Footnote458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> by
heating the oxide with fine calcium turnings in an evacuated
iron tube; the powdered product is washed, in absence of air,
and heated in an evacuated porcelain tube to 800°-1000°, at
which temperature the powder sinters into lumps which take
a brilliant polish and contain 99·1 per cent. of the metal.
Attempts to prepare a purer product from this by the method
of Weiss and Neumann were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The amorphous metal is a dark powder, which when washed
with water on the filter paper passes through as a dark blue
colloidal solution; it burns readily when heated in the air.
According to Wedekind and Lewis,<a id="FNanchor459"></a><a href="#Footnote459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> amorphous zirconium is
really the colloidal form of the metal. The fused metal is
very hard (7-8, Mohs’ scale&mdash;it scratches quartz but not
topaz) and very brittle; it has the density 6·4, and is of a
whitish colour, with good metallic lustre on freshly broken
surfaces. The atomic heat is abnormally high, being approximately
7·3; the element is paramagnetic. The melting-point<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
was given by Wedekind and Lewis<a id="FNanchor460"></a><a href="#Footnote460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> as 2330°-2380°, but later
work of the former author<a id="FNanchor461"></a><a href="#Footnote461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> gives the much lower value of 1530°,
which seems more probable in view of the fact that the element
cannot be employed for electric lamp filaments (see <a href="#Page322">p. 322</a>).</p>

<p>Metallic zirconium is highly resistant to acids; it is attacked
only by hydrofluoric acid and by aqua regia. In the compact
form it burns in the air only at very high temperatures, though
when powdered it glows in the air at a red heat, forming
probably a mixture of lower oxides. It is attacked by chlorine
and by hydrogen chloride at a red heat, with formation of
the chloride; fused potash also oxidises it, with evolution
of hydrogen. When heated in a current of hydrogen at a
red heat, it forms the <i>hydride</i>, ZrH₂,<a id="FNanchor462"></a><a href="#Footnote462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
as a velvet-black powder,
which burns with an intense bluish flame in oxygen, forming
the sesquioxide, Zr₂O₃. When heated in nitrogen or ammonia,
amorphous zirconium yields <i>nitrides</i>, which are also obtained
when any attempt is made to reduce zirconium compounds
to the metal in air. The most definite is the compound Zr₂N₃,<a href="#Footnote462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
which forms a bronze-coloured powder, resistant to all mineral
acids except hydrofluoric acid. Chlorine and bromine transform
this to the halide.</p>

<p>The <i>hydroxide</i> is of doubtful individuality, since on drying
it loses water progressively as the temperature is raised,
no definite stable compound being known; in this respect
zirconium resembles titanium. When heated to 100°, its
composition corresponds approximately with that required
by the formula ZrO₂,H₂O, but the percentage of water varies
with the history of the specimen. When precipitated by
alkalies in the cold, it forms the so-called α or ortho modification,
which, like the analogous titanium compound, is readily
soluble in dilute acids, and glows when heated. By precipitation
at the boiling point, the β form is obtained; this
is less soluble in acids, and does not glow when heated. The
differences between the two forms are by no means sharply
marked; they are rather the limiting forms of a continuously
varying series than distinct chemical individuals, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
properties of any hydroxide precipitate depend very largely
on the conditions under which it is thrown down.</p>

<p>The hydroxide is insoluble in water, but can be obtained
in colloidal solution after it has been repeatedly heated with
dilute acids, which serve to break down the molecular complexes;
it can be also readily obtained in colloidal solution
by dialysis of the nitrate, chloride, or acetate. In these solutions
it is positively charged; electrolytes precipitate it with great
ease. The gel has a very high power of forming adsorption
products. When thrown down from solution by soda or
potash, it carries down considerable quantities of alkali, to
which it clings so tenaciously that the most careful washing
cannot entirely remove them. If the gel be placed in contact
with an ammoniacal solution of a cupric compound, it
removes the cuprammonium complex entirely from the solution,
becoming itself deep blue in colour, and leaving the liquid
quite clear and colourless. In colloidal solution it forms
adsorption compounds with negatively charged colloids,
especially metals, the gels obtained from such solutions containing
both colloids.</p>

<p>In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, ammonia throws
down an hydrated peroxide, which is also obtained<a id="FNanchor463"></a><a href="#Footnote463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> by electrolysis
of a brine solution in which the hydroxide is suspended,
oxidation being effected by the sodium hypochlorite formed.
This reaction is expressed by the equation:</p>

<p class="equation">Zr(OH)₄ + NaOCl = Zr(OOH)(OH)₃ + NaCl</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is an endothermic compound, and is very unstable,
losing oxygen on standing; by the action of acids it gives
hydrogen peroxide. It dissolves in alkalies containing hydrogen
peroxide; from such solutions, alcohol precipitates salts
of the formula R´₄Zr₂O₁₁,9H₂O.</p>

<p><i>Zirconium oxide</i>, ZrO₂, occurs in nature; it can be obtained
in the laboratory as a voluminous white powder by ignition
of the hydroxide or a suitable salt. The physical properties
are described under the mineral Baddeleyite (<a href="#Page75">p. 75</a>) and in
<a href="#Page313">Chapter XXI</a> (<a href="#Page323">p. 323</a>),
in which an account of its technical<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
applications is given. The melting-point is probably about
2700°; at 3000° it begins to volatilise. It dissolves readily
in mineral acids, unless previously ignited very strongly;
all specimens dissolve easily in hydrofluoric acid, and are
readily converted by concentrated sulphuric acid into the
sulphate.</p>

<p>When fused with metallic oxides or carbonates, it gives
crystalline <i>zirconates</i>, of which a large number have been
prepared; the calcium compound, CaZrO₃, is said to be
isomorphous with perovskite, CaTiO₃.</p>

<p>A <i>suboxide</i>, ZrO, of somewhat doubtful individuality,<a id="FNanchor464"></a><a href="#Footnote464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> is
said to be obtained when the dioxide is reduced with magnesium;
it forms a dry black powder, which is not attacked
by acids, and when heated glows, forming the dioxide. A
<i>sesquioxide</i>, Zr₂O₃, is obtained as a greenish powder when the
hydride is burnt in oxygen; when heated in the air, it oxidises
very slowly, forming the dioxide.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote464"><a href="#FNanchor464"><span class="label">[464]</span></a>
Wedekind and Teletow (<i>Annalen</i>, 1913, <b>395</b>, 149) have recently denied
the existence of this oxide.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>An <i>oxysulphide</i>, ZrOS, is obtained when the anhydrous
sulphate is heated in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen;
it is a bright yellow powder, which ignites spontaneously in
the air. No disulphide is known. The <i>carbide</i>, ZrC, is obtained,
according to Moissan and Lengfeld,<a id="FNanchor465"></a><a href="#Footnote465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> when the oxide is heated
with carbon in any proportions, excess of carbon separating
on cooling as graphite; the process is hastened by addition
of lime. It is a hard, dark-grey solid, and is a very good
conductor of electricity. When heated in oxygen or nitrogen,
it reacts readily, forming the oxide and nitride respectively;
halogens attack it at quite low temperatures (250°-400°),
forming the halide compounds, which are indeed best prepared
in this way. Strong mineral acids, with the exception
of hydrochloric acid, attack it, and fused alkalies dissolve
it readily.</p>

<p>The <i>fluoride</i>, ZrF₄, is best obtained by the action of anhydrous
hydrofluoric acid on the chloride. It forms a white
crystalline mass, which readily sublimes, and is soluble in
hydrofluoric acid; from the solution it crystallises as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
trihydrate, ZrF₄,3H₂O. The anhydrous substance is very
slightly soluble in water in the cold; when warmed, it hydrolyses,
forming the hydroxide. The solution in hydrofluoric
acid dissolves metallic carbonates and oxides, forming the
numerous <i>fluozirconates</i> or <i>zirconofluorides</i>.</p>

<p>There are many types of these compounds, of which the
potassium salt, K₂ZrF₆, is the most important. The solubility
of this salt increases very rapidly with the temperature; 100
parts of water dissolve, at 15°, 1·41 parts, at 100°, 25 parts of
the compound. It has been frequently used for the purification
of zirconium compounds, for the preparation of the element, and
for analytical determinations. Other potassium salts, K₃ZrF₇ and
KZrF₅,H₂O, are obtained by using a large excess of potassium
fluoride and zirconium fluoride respectively. The ammonium
compounds are analogous in composition to the potassium
salts, but the sodium salt, Na₅ZrF₉, is obtained from mixtures
of the components in all proportions; on account of its very
low solubility, it can be obtained by double decomposition of
the potassium salt with sodium chloride. Of the salts with
divalent metals, the types R´´ZrF₆,<i>x</i>H₂O and R´´₂ZrF₈,<i>x</i>H₂O,
are the most common.</p>

<p>The <i>chloride</i>, ZrCl₄, is known, on account of the ease with
which it hydrolyses, in the anhydrous state only. It can
be obtained by all the usual methods, of which perhaps the
action of chlorine on the carbide, and of carbon tetrachloride, or
a mixture of chlorine and sulphur monochloride, on the oxide,
are the most convenient; an interesting method consists
in heating the oxide with phosphorus pentachloride in a
closed tube at 190°. It forms a volatile white sublimate,
which fumes strongly in air, and reacts vigorously with water;
it is soluble in ether. It forms a series of addition compounds
with ammonia and organic bases, as well as with the chlorides
of non-metallic elements; warmed with phosphorus pentachloride,
it forms a stable solid, 2ZrCl₄,PCl₅, which melts at
240°, and boils at 345°. With organic compounds, especially
with esters, acids, and phenols, it forms a long series of addition
and condensation products, of which the compounds
ZrCl₄(C₆H₅·COOC₂H₅)₂ and ZrCl₂[O·C₆H₅·CHO]₂ may be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
as examples. By addition of organic bases to a solution of
the chloride in alcoholic hydrogen chloride, double chlorides
of the type (C₅H₅NH)₂ZrCl₆ are obtained.</p>

<p>The <i>oxychloride</i>, ZrOCl₂,8H₂O, separates in characteristic
tetragonal prisms when the tetrachloride is dissolved in water
or hydrochloric acid of any concentration. It is readily soluble
in water and alcohol, but sparingly soluble in hydrochloric
acid, from which therefore it is generally recrystallised. According
to Chauvenet,<a id="FNanchor466"></a><a href="#Footnote466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> it effloresces in dry air, forming the hexahydrate,
ZrOCl₂,6H₂O; when dried in a vacuum, it forms the
hydrate, ZrOCl₂,3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>H₂O, whilst the dihydrate, ZrOCl₂,2H₂O,
is obtained by heating at 100°-105° in hydrogen chloride.
When the dihydrate is heated to 230°, it forms another basic
chloride, ZrOCl₂ZrO₂,<a id="FNanchor467"></a><a href="#Footnote467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> which is stable up to 600°; above this
temperature, it breaks up, forming the volatile tetrachloride,
and leaving a residue of the dioxide.</p>

<p>By repeated evaporation of the oxychloride with small
quantities of water, a ‘metazirconium chloride’ is obtained,
which dissolves in water to a colloidal solution, and on dialysis
yields a colloidal solution of ‘metazirconic acid.’</p>

<p>The <i>bromide</i>, ZrBr₄, very closely resembles the chloride;
when treated with water it forms the oxybromide, which
separates from solution according to the conditions in various
hydrated forms, of which the commonest is the octohydrate,
ZrOBr₂,8H₂O. The <i>iodide</i>, ZrI₄, is a very reactive body,
which closely resembles the preceding; it forms an oxyiodide,
ZrOI₂,8H₂O.</p>

<p><i>Zirconyl chlorate</i>, ZrO(ClO₃)₂,6H₂O, is obtained from the
sulphate by double decomposition with barium chlorate;
it forms very soluble colourless needles. Alkali iodates or
iodic acid throw down a voluminous <i>oxyiodate</i>, very sparingly
soluble, like the corresponding ceric and thorium salts, in
water and acids.</p>

<p><i>The Sulphates.</i>&mdash;When zirconium dioxide is dissolved in
concentrated sulphuric acid, and the excess of acid removed
by heating to 400°, the ‘neutral’ sulphate, Zr(SO₄)₂, remains.
The compound dissolves in dilute sulphuric acid to form
solutions which contain various ‘complexes’ as shown by<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
conductivity measurements, and the behaviour towards
oxalic acid. Whilst solutions of the nitrate or chloride give
immediate precipitates with this reagent, solutions of the
‘sulphate’ give no precipitate, or at most a very gradual
one; moreover, addition of sulphuric acid or of alkali sulphates
to other zirconium salts inhibits the oxalate precipitation.
These facts are explained by regarding the ‘neutral’ sulphate,
Zr(SO₄)₂,4H₂O, as zirconylsulphuric acid, ZrOSO₄,H₂SO₄,3H₂O,
which in solution ionises to 2H<sup>.</sup> and ZrOSO₄,SO₄´´. This
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that whilst in solutions
of the chloride in hydrochloric acid, zirconium goes on electrolysis
to the cathode, on addition of sulphuric acid to the solution
it travels to the anode. The anhydrous compound and the
hydrate are extremely soluble in water, but much less readily
soluble in dilute sulphuric acid. Probably in solution more
complex salts are formed by further hydrolysis, for by addition
of concentrated alkali sulphate solution in the cold, double
salts of the formula Zr₂O₃(RSO₄)₂,8H₂O are obtained. When
the solution is kept for some time at 39°-40°, a basic sulphate,
4ZrO₂,3SO₃,14H₂O, separates slowly. When concentrated
solutions are boiled, a salt, 2ZrO₂,3SO₃,5H₂O, separates as a
crystalline precipitate; in contact with water it slowly hydrates
itself to the compound 2ZrO₂,3SO₃,14H₂O; when heated
to 300°, it becomes anhydrous without further change.
Various other basic, acid and complex salts have also been
described.</p>

<p>The <i>nitrate</i>, Zr(NO₃)₄,5H₂O, separates from concentrated
solutions of the oxide in nitric acid by evaporation over
sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide; it is believed to be
a zirconylnitric acid, ZrO(NO₃)₂,2HNO₃,4H₂O by analogy
with the sulphate. When its aqueous solutions are warmed,
basic salts separate. Kolbe<a id="FNanchor468"></a><a href="#Footnote468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> has described an additive
compound with antipyrine, Zr(NO₃)₄,6C₁₁H₁₂ON₂, which is

<p><i>Zirconyl oxalate</i>, ZrO,C₂O₄, is obtained in the hydrated
form when oxalic acid is added to a zirconium salt in the
presence of hydrochloric or acetic acid. It is a white powder,
soluble in oxalic acid, and easily hydrolysed by water. If an
aqueous solution of oxalic acid be saturated with zirconium
hydroxide, an acid oxalate, ZrOH(HC₂O₄)₃,7H₂O, is obtained on
evaporation. Double oxalates are readily obtained by dissolving
zirconium hydroxide in solutions of alkali hydrogen oxalates,
the general form being Zr(C₂O₄R´)₄,xH₂O. The <i>tartrate</i> precipitated

solutions of alkali oxalates on addition of zirconium compounds.

double alkali tartrates have been prepared; the potassium
salt, ZrO(C₄H₄O₆K)₂,3H₂O, is analogous to the thorium alkali

<h5 class="inline"><b>Atomic Weight of Zirconium.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The value of this constant is
not very accurately known. The International Committee has
adopted the value 90·6, but there is some uncertainty as to
the value of the decimal fraction. Berzelius in 1825 employed
the analytical sulphate method, and found Zr = 88·47. The
numbers of Hermann (1844), obtained by the analysis of the
oxychloride, 2ZrOCl₂,9H₂O,<a id="FNanchor471"></a><a href="#Footnote471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> were very discordant, the mean
giving the value 89·56. Marignac in 1860 analysed the potassium
salt, K₂ZrF₆; this he heated with strong sulphuric acid,
the residue being ignited until all the zirconium sulphate was
transformed to oxide; the weighed mixture was then freed
from potassium sulphate, and the residual oxide dried and
weighed. From the three ratios K₂ZrF₆&nbsp;: ZrO₂, K₂ZrF₆&nbsp;: H₂SO₄,
and K₂SO₄&nbsp;: ZrO₂, he obtained the mean values 90·02, 91·55,

<p>Bailey carried out a series of analytical sulphate determinations

criticises the method on the ground that the preparation of
the pure neutral anhydrous sulphate is almost impossible;
the sulphate heated to 400° is not yet anhydrous, so that
Bailey’s result, on this ground, is probably too low. Venable
in 1898 analysed the oxychloride; he claimed to have obtained
the compound ZrOCl₂,3H₂O, by heating the crystallised salt
at 100°-125° in hydrogen chloride, a method which Chauvenet

<p>(3) A solution of a zirconium salt in hydrochloric acid

<p>The <i>estimation</i> of zirconium is complicated by the difficulty
of separating it from the accompanying elements. The
solubility of the oxalate in oxalic acid allows of a rapid and
easy separation from thorium and rare earth elements, so that
iron, aluminium, and chromium only remain to be removed.
Iron may be separated by the thiosulphate method, or other
processes mentioned on p. 338; when free from that element,
zirconium may be separated from aluminium and chromium
by precipitation with alkali iodate in presence of the least
possible excess of acid. The precipitates in the thiosulphate
and iodate methods may be washed, and ignited directly to
the dioxide, which is weighed as such; if the zirconium is
left after separation in solution, it may be precipitated with
ammonia,<a id="FNanchor473"></a><a href="#Footnote473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and after washing and drying, ignited and weighed

<h4><b>Thorium</b>, Th = 232·4</h4>

<p>The name Thoria (thorina) was proposed by Berzelius
in 1817 for what appeared to be a new earth, but which in
1824 was recognised as a basic yttria phosphate. In 1828 a
new mineral was discovered by Esmark near Brevig in Norway;<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
to the oxide isolated from this, Berzelius gave the name thoria,
from its resemblance to the substance he had obtained in 1817.
The homogeneity of the new element was questioned by Bergmann
in 1857, and also by Bahr in 1862, but the conclusions
of those authors have been shown to be quite unfounded.</p>

<p>Thorium occurs in traces in a large number of common
minerals, and in varying quantities in most of the uranium
and rare earth minerals. Its occurrence in monazite, and the
distribution of the latter mineral, have already been dealt
with; the commercial treatment of monazite is described in
<a href="#Page275">Chapter XVIII</a>. The oxide forms the chief constituent in
Thorite, with its gem-variety Orangite, and the various
secondary minerals, and in the mineral Thorianite, in which
the only other important constituent is uranous oxide. The
extraction from these minerals is a comparatively simple
matter. Decomposition is easily effected by hydrochloric
or sulphuric acid, thorianite dissolving easily also in nitric
acid; the solutions obtained, after appropriate treatment to
remove silica, excess of acid, etc., are treated with sulphuretted
hydrogen, to remove lead, bismuth, and similar foreign metals,
and freed from the rare earths by the carbonate, oxalate, or
sulphate methods. The last depends on the fact that thorium
sulphate and its hydrates are much less soluble than corresponding
compounds of the rare earth elements; the first
two on the fact that thorium salts dissolve readily in excess
of alkali carbonates or oxalates, whilst the rare earth compounds
are much less easily soluble.</p>

<p>Thorium, like zirconium, forms only one series of salts,
in which the metal is tetravalent. The formula ThO was
originally put forward by Berzelius for the oxide, from its
resemblance to the ceria and yttria oxides, and its general
occurrence with these. The true formula was deduced, when
the valency of zirconium had been decided by the vapour
density experiments of Troost and Deville, in 1857, from the
isomorphism of zircon and thorite, and the close relationship
between the compounds of the two elements, especially among
the double fluorides, and was confirmed by a determination
of the specific heat of the metal by Nilson in 1883.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span></p>

<p>In its chemical relations, the element resembles zirconium,
though, as is to be expected from the high atomic weight,
it shows a much more marked electropositive character,
approaching in this respect the elements of the yttrium group.
The oxide has no longer acid properties, and the neutral
salts, though they hydrolyse readily and are therefore acid
to indicators in solution, may be recrystallised unchanged from
aqueous solution. The tendency to form double salts is still
present, though diminished; the oxalate is soluble in a large
excess of alkali oxalate, but not in oxalic acid, and the double
fluorides are less numerous and varied than those of zirconium
and titanium. On the other hand, it forms a well-crystallised
and characteristic series of double nitrates, R´₂Th(NO₃)₆,
isomorphous with the analogous ceric salts. In the behaviour
of its sulphate it differs markedly from zirconium, and closely
approaches the rare earth elements. The hydroxide has the
characteristic tendency to form colloidal solutions and gels.</p>

<p>Thorium is peculiar, among the elements which have been
considered, through its property of giving characteristic
radiations, and disintegrating with formation of a whole
family of new elements; or, as it is commonly expressed,
through its radioactive properties.<a id="FNanchor474"></a><a href="#Footnote474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> The element has a
half-life period of the order of 4 × 10¹⁰ years; in the course
of decay, it gives rise to mesothorium 1, which is rayless,
but decays to mesothorium 2, with its product radiothorium,
both of which give powerful radiations. Mesothorium 1 of
course occurs in all thorium-containing minerals, and may be
separated from monazite by addition of a barium compound
during the sulphuric acid decomposition; in consequence of
the powerful radiating properties of its products, it is itself
of considerable importance, and proposals for extracting it
from monazite in the preparation of the thorium nitrate of
commerce have been put forward (see <a href="#Page276">p. 276</a>).</p>

The nature of the present work allows only the briefest reference to be
made to the exceedingly interesting phenomena which centre about this
subject; for a more complete account, the student should consult Soddy,
<i>The Chemistry of the Radio-Elements</i>, Part I, 1911.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Mesothorium appears to be chemically identical with
radium; since monazite, like all other thorium-bearing minerals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
contains uranium and radium, the latter element is separated
with the mesothorium, and indeed, having a very much larger
half-life period, constitutes by far the greater part of such
‘mesothorium’ preparations. On account of the great
activity of the mesothorium products, the best preparations
from monazite, though estimated to contain only 1 per
cent. of mesothorium to 99 per cent. radium, are said to
be four times as active as pure radium compounds. The
chemical identity of the two products seems to preclude
any possibility of determining the physical properties and
constants of mesothorium.</p>

<p>The element radiothorium, which was discovered by Hahn
in 1905, in the mineral thorianite, is chemically identical
with the parent element thorium, but can be separated by
means of the intermediate element, mesothorium 1. The
latter is readily separated by the sulphate precipitation, and
the radiothorium to which it gives rise may be separated by
precipitation with ammonia. Thorium is also chemically
identical with ionium, the parent of radium, and the thorium
nitrate of commerce therefore contains important quantities
of ionium&mdash;important that is, in view of the high radiating
power of the latter element. The study of these relationships
constitutes one of the most important and interesting fields
in the province of radioactivity.</p>

<p><i>The Metal.</i>&mdash;Elementary thorium has not yet been obtained
in the pure state, owing to the ease with which it forms compounds
and alloys with all the common elements, and to its
great affinity for oxygen; the high melting-point also increases
the difficulty of obtaining the pure metal. Berzelius
attempted to reduce the alkali double fluorides and double
chlorides with sodium or potassium; Nilson carried out the
same reaction in a closed iron cylinder, but his product still
contained 20 per cent. of thoria. Reduction of the oxide with
magnesium is never complete, and the carbon method gives
only a mixture of carbide and metal. Electrolytic methods
give no better results, since the metal liberated at the cathode
always encloses oxide and other impurities. Moissan and
Hönigschmid in 1906, by heating the carefully purified<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
anhydrous chloride with sodium in a sealed glass tube from
which air and moisture had been removed, claim to have
obtained a product containing only 3 per cent. of the oxide.
The element has recently been prepared in leaf form by forcing
the amorphous product into the bore of a copper tube, hammering
into sheets, and removing the copper by dilute nitric
acid.<a id="FNanchor475"></a><a href="#Footnote475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The amorphous impure metal is a dark grey powder, of
specific gravity 11·3; the hammered and strongly heated
leaf has the density 12·16. It burns readily in air with great
brilliance, and when finely powdered ignites if crushed
or rubbed. When heated in the electric furnace, it melts,
according to von Bolton,<a id="FNanchor476"></a><a href="#Footnote476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
at about 1450°; von Wartenburg<a id="FNanchor477"></a><a href="#Footnote477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
found the melting-point to be about 1700°; the fused beads
resemble platinum in physical properties. It is somewhat
resistant to acids, dissolving easily only in aqua regia, and
more slowly in fuming hydrochloric acid. It combines directly
when heated in sulphur or halogens, and in nitrogen and
hydrogen.</p>

<p>The <i>hydride</i>, ThH₄, is best obtained by heating the metal
in hydrogen, an energetic reaction taking place at a red heat.
Winkler observed that a mixture of the dioxide with magnesium
absorbs hydrogen readily when heated. The hydride is a
stable greyish-black powder, not attacked by water, but
dissolving readily in hydrochloric acid, with evolution of
hydrogen. The <i>nitride</i>, Th₃N₄, is prepared by heating the
metal in the gas, or the carbide in a stream of ammonia. It
is a brown powder, decomposed by water with evolution of
ammonia and formation of the dioxide. The <i>azide</i> has been
used for purposes of detection and estimation, since in boiling
solution it is hydrolysed with separation of the hydroxide;
zirconium and ceric salts also show this reaction, but the rare
earth salts give no precipitate.</p>

<p>The <i>hydroxide</i>, Th(OH)₄,<i>x</i>H₂O, is precipitated from solutions
of thorium salts by alkalies or ammonia, as a gelatinous white
precipitate, insoluble in excess. It dissolves readily in mineral<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
acids or in alkali carbonates. Hydrogen peroxide and ammonia
throw down an hydrated <i>peroxide</i>, Th₂O₇; from neutral
solutions hydrogen peroxide alone throws down <i>peroxy-salts</i>,
which contain acid groups. This peroxide may also be obtained
by the action of sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide on
the hydroxide, as in the case of the zirconium compound. It
readily gives up oxygen, passing into the more stable peroxide,
ThO₃. Since in neutral or faintly acid solutions zirconium
and the rare earths give no precipitate with hydrogen peroxide,
the reaction is extremely useful in the detection and estimation
of thorium.</p>

<p><i>Thorium dioxide</i>, ThO₂, is obtained by the ignition of
the hydroxide or of suitable salts as a white powder, of which
the properties and appearance depend largely on the method
and temperature used in its formation. Whilst the residue
obtained by ignition of the nitrate is an extraordinarily voluminous
and light flaky mass, the sulphate yields a dense
thick powder; the nitrate was therefore always preferred
in the manufacture of <a href="#Page265">incandescent mantles</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), as it was
thought that the oxide obtained from it was the most suitable
for illumination. In the crystalline form the oxide has been
obtained in the laboratory by fusion with borax and with
potassium phosphate. The first method gives tetragonal crystals,
probably isomorphous with those of rutile and cassiterite;
the phosphate fusion is said to give cubic crystals (see <a href="#Page74">p. 74</a>).
The oxide is insoluble in acids, but can be transformed into
the sulphate by evaporation with concentrated sulphuric acid,
or fusion with alkali bisulphate. It does not liberate carbon
dioxide when fused with alkali carbonates.</p>

<p>By repeated evaporation with small quantities of acids,
thoria can be transformed into a gel soluble in water (thorium
meta-oxide). The sol is an opalescent fluid, orange-red by
transmitted light, and contains small quantities of the acid
employed. The hydroxide may also be obtained in this form
by carefully washing it, and boiling with small quantities of
acids, or with thorium or other salts, or even by long continued
washing with pure water; similarly, continued dialysis of
thorium salts eventually yields such gels. The colloid is<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
positively charged, and resembles the zirconium oxide gel
in its relation to negatively charged colloids. The gel is
easily precipitated by electrolytes.</p>

<p>Ignited thorium oxide has found considerable application
in recent years a catalyst in the preparation of ketones by
the contact method of Sabatier and Senderens.<a id="FNanchor478"></a><a href="#Footnote478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> By passing
mixtures of the vapours of appropriate acids over the catalyst

<p>The <i>sulphide</i>, ThS₂, is obtained, together with the oxysulphide,

sulphuretted hydrogen over a mixture of thorium chloride
with excess of sodium chloride, at a red heat. The former
forms large brown crystals, from which the small orange-yellow
crystals of the oxysulphide may be separated by means
of a sieve; the latter is purified by treatment with warm
nitric acid, which dissolves the sulphide very readily. The
oxysulphide is also obtained when the anhydrous sulphate
is heated in sulphuretted hydrogen.<a id="FNanchor481"></a><a href="#Footnote481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p><i>Thorium fluoride</i>, ThF₄, is obtained anhydrous by passing
hydrogen fluoride over the anhydrous chloride or bromide at
a temperature of 350°-400°. The tetrahydrate, ThF₄,4H₂O,
is precipitated by addition of hydrofluoric acid to a solution
of a thorium salt, or by the action of the acid on the hydroxide.
Hydrofluosilicic acid also throws down the fluoride, even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
the cold, from solutions of thorium salts. The fluoride is
insoluble in water and mineral acids, as well as in excess of
precipitant; this behaviour allows of a complete and easy
separation of thorium from titanium and zirconium. The
rare earth fluorides are also much more easily soluble in concentrated
mineral acids than thorium fluoride, so that this
compound may also be used in the separation from the rare
earths. When heated in a stream of the acid to 800°, the
hydrated salt yields the oxyfluoride, ThOF₂; ignited in the
air, it leaves the dioxide. Precipitation with potassium
fluoride gives the <i>double fluoride</i>, KThF₅,H₂O, which may be
obtained anhydrous by fusion of the mixed fluorides; it is
insoluble. An amorphous insoluble compound, K₂ThF₆,4H₂O,
is obtained by boiling the hydroxide with a mixture of potassium
hydrogen fluoride and hydrofluoric acid. Sodium and
ammonium fluorides throw down the simple fluoride.</p>

<p><i>Thorium chloride</i>, ThCl₄, is obtained in the anhydrous
form by all the usual methods, the most convenient being
perhaps the action of chlorine and sulphur monochloride on
the heated dioxide. It almost invariably contains small
quantities of oxychloride. When pure, it forms colourless
needles fairly stable in dry air; the impure product gradually
darkens in colour. It dissolves in water with considerable
evolution of heat, and is soluble also in alcohol and moist
ether. It melts at about 820°, and sublimes unchanged at
somewhat higher temperatures; the vapour begins to dissociate
at about 1050°, the dissociation increasing rapidly as
the temperature rises. It resembles zirconium chloride in the
ease with which it forms additive compounds with ammonia and
organic bases, and addition and condensation products with
organic oxygen-compounds; many <i>double</i> and <i>complex chlorides</i>
are also known, among which the platinum compounds
ThPtCl₈,12H₂O and Th₂Pt₃Cl₁₄,24H₂O, and the pyridine salt
(C₅H₅NH)₂ThCl₆ may be mentioned.</p>

<p>From aqueous solution the octohydrate, ThCl₄,8H₂O,
separates at ordinary temperatures; a heptahydrate and an
enneahydrate have been described as precipitated from the
alcoholic solution by addition of water. The <i>basic salts</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
Th(OH)Cl₃,7H₂O and Th(OH)₂Cl₂,5H₂O, have been obtained
by addition of the hydroxide to alcoholic hydrogen chloride.
The <i>oxychloride</i>, ThOCl₂, may be obtained by the carefully
regulated action of carbon tetrachloride on the dioxide, according
to the equation:</p>

<p class="equation">ThO₂ + CCl₄ = ThOCl₂ + COCl₂</p>

<p class="noindent">It is a colourless crystalline solid, which takes up moisture
from the air, forming the hexahydrate.</p>

<p><i>Thorium bromide</i>, ThBr₄, is a volatile solid which boils
at 725°; it closely resembles the chloride. The <i>iodide</i> and a
<i>basic iodide</i>, Th(OH)I₃,10H₂O, are known.</p>

<p>No cyanide of thorium is known, addition of potassium
cyanide merely causing separation of the hydroxide. A
<i>ferrocyanide</i>, Th[Fe(CN)₆],4H₂O, is thrown down as a white
powder by potassium ferrocyanide; with potassium ferricyanide
no precipitate is obtained. The <i>platinocyanide</i>,
Th[Pt(CN)₄]₂,16H₂O, is obtained by double decomposition in
yellowish-brown prisms.</p>

<p>Among the halogen oxysalts, the <i>perchlorate</i>, <i>chlorate</i>,
<i>bromate</i>, and <i>iodate</i> were prepared by Cleve. The iodate is
of great importance for purposes of detection and estimation,
from the fact that, in presence of a large excess of alkali iodate,
it is insoluble in strong nitric acid, whilst the analogous compounds
of the rare earth elements dissolve readily in that
solvent.</p>

<p>The <i>sulphate</i>, Th(SO₄)₂, is obtained anhydrous by evaporating
the excess of acid from a solution of the dioxide in oil
of vitriol, or by heating the hydrates. It resembles the sulphates
of the rare earth elements, in that it dissolves in water
at 0° to form a highly supersaturated solution, from which
the hydrated forms separate out almost quantitatively when
the temperature is allowed to rise. The solubility relations
of the various hydrates, on account of their commercial importance,
are somewhat fully treated in <a href="#Page275">Chapter XVIII</a>. A
dihydrate, Th(SO₄)₂,2H₂O, is obtained by keeping the tetrahydrate
at 110°. The ennea- and octohydrates are isomorphous
with the corresponding thorium selenate hydrates, and the
ennea- and tetrahydrates with the analogous uranous sulphate<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
hydrates. The hydrates yield the anhydrous salt when heated
to 400°; the anhydrous sulphate has already a considerable
dissociation tension (15 mm.) at 575°. By treatment with
excess of acid, and subsequent heating to 130° <i>in vacuo</i>, the
<i>acid sulphate</i>, Th(SO₄),H₂SO₄, is obtained. An insoluble <i>basic
salt</i>, ThOSO₄,2H₂O, is formed by continued boiling of the
tetrahydrate in dilute solution, or more quickly by heating
the solution in a closed tube to 120°-125°; a monohydrate,
ThOSO₄,H₂O, is also known. Halla<a id="FNanchor483"></a><a href="#Footnote483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> has recently obtained
the hydrate, ThOSO₄,5H₂O, by boiling a solution of the
neutral sulphate with magnesium sulphate, and also by
treating the anhydrous sulphate with a little water in
presence of magnesium carbonate.</p>

<p>By precipitation with potassium sulphate the <i>double salt</i>,
Th(SO₄)₂,2K₂SO₄,2H₂O, is formed; this is soluble in water
but insoluble in potassium sulphate solution. The analogous
sodium and ammonium salts are soluble both in water and
excess of the corresponding alkali sulphate.</p>

<p>The <i>sulphite</i>, Th(SO₃)₂,H₂O, is obtained as a white amorphous
precipitate by warming a solution of a thorium salt
with sulphurous acid. Basic sulphites and double sulphites
are also known; the precipitates obtained by addition of
alkali sulphite dissolve readily in excess. The hydroxide
is almost insoluble in sulphurous acid, behaviour which distinguishes
thorium (and zirconium) from all the trivalent
metals. No <i>thiosulphate</i> is known, the hydroxide being thrown
down from boiling solution by addition of sodium thiosulphate:
this method of precipitation was formerly much used for
purposes of estimation, but it is more tedious and less accurate
than the modern methods.</p>

<p><i>Thorium nitrate</i>, Th(NO₃)₄,12H₂O, crystallises at ordinary
temperatures in large hygroscopic tablets, very soluble
in water and alcohol. The hydrates, Th(NO₃)₄,6H₂O and
Th(NO₃)₄,5H₂O, have been obtained from hot solution and
from nitric acid solution respectively. Thorium is employed
in commerce almost entirely in the form of this salt, which is
dehydrated until it contains about 48 per cent. ThO₂, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
approximates to the formula Th(NO₃)₄,4H₂O; the commercial
product, however, is not a definite hydrate. Kolbe<a id="FNanchor484"></a><a href="#Footnote484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> has described
the additive product with antipyrine, 2Th(NO₃)₄,5C₁₁H₁₂ON₂,
which melts at 168°. The extent to which thorium salts are
hydrolysed in solution is very considerable, as is evident from
the fact that the nitrate may be titrated with standard potash
in presence of phenolphthalein as indicator; the solution
first becomes alkaline to this reagent when 3·5 molecules
of potash have been added for each molecule of thorium

<p><i>Thorium phosphates.</i>&mdash;The precipitates obtained by addition
of phosphoric acid or alkali phosphates to solutions of thorium
salts are gelatinous solids of doubtful composition; they
dissolve in mineral acids and in alkali carbonates, and their
behaviour is of great importance in the technical treatment
of monazite. Various phosphates and <i>double phosphates</i>
are obtained by fusion methods, but none of these are
important. The <i>phosphite</i>, Th(HPO₃)₂,3H₂O, and <i>hypophosphite</i>,
Th(H₂PO₂)₄, are insoluble solids obtained by
double decomposition. The <i>hypophosphate</i> ThP₂O₆,11H₂O,
is of great importance for purposes of detection and estimation,
since it is thrown down quantitatively from strongly
acid solutions; under these conditions the rare earths remain
in solution.</p>

<p>No neutral <i>carbonate</i> of thorium is known. Alkali carbonates
precipitate a basic salt, which dissolves readily in
excess; this fact is of very great importance in the commercial
extraction of thorium, the sodium and ammonium double
carbonates of the cerium elements being almost insoluble
in alkali carbonates. Addition of alcohol to the solution
throws down double carbonates, which can be washed with ice
water. The salts K₆Th(CO₃)₅,10H₂O, Na₆Th(CO₃)₅,12H₂O, and
(NH₄)₂Th(CO₃)₃,6H₂O have been obtained in this way; they
dissolve readily in water or dilute alkali carbonate, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
on warming or diluting the solution, the hydroxide separates.
The thallium compound, Tl₆Th(CO₃)₅, is sparingly soluble,
and is thrown down from a solution of the ammonium
compound on addition of a thallium salt; it has been
proposed for the microchemical detection of thorium. The
quantitative separation of thorium by means of pure moist
lead carbonate has been proposed for the purpose of estimation
(see <a href="#Page288">p. 288</a>).</p>

<p><i>Thorium oxalate</i>, Th(C₂O₄)₂,6H₂O, is precipitated quantitatively
by means of oxalic acid, even in presence of considerable
quantities of mineral acids. It is less soluble in sulphuric
acid than any of the rare earth oxalates,<a id="FNanchor486"></a><a href="#Footnote486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> and is not attacked,
as are the latter compounds, by concentrated nitric acid. In
hydrochloric acid the solubility first increases rapidly with
the concentration of the acid, and then suddenly decreases;
this behaviour is due to the formation of an <i>oxalochloride</i>,
3Th(C₂O₄)₂,ThCl₄,20H₂O. When the amorphous oxalate obtained
by precipitation is allowed to remain for a considerable
time in contact with acids, it forms characteristic
tetragonal prisms of the more stable form. The dihydrate,
Th(C₂O₄)₂,2H₂O, is obtained when the hexahydrate is dried over
sulphuric acid, or heated to 100°. The salt dissolves easily
in excess of alkali oxalate, but is precipitated from the solutions
by mineral acids, a fact which allows of another means of
separation from zirconium, the double oxalates of which
are much more stable towards acids. The solubility of the
oxalate in alkali oxalate allows of separation from the rare
earth elements, whilst its insolubility in excess of oxalic acid
can be used for the separation from zirconium.</p>

<p>The <i>formate</i> and <i>acetate</i> can be obtained in the form of
neutral salts by the action of the acids on the hydroxide;
by double decomposition, amorphous precipitates of basic salts
are obtained. With <i>tartaric acid</i> stable complex compounds
are formed, as shown by the fact that alkalies will not precipitate
the hydroxide from a solution in presence of that
reagent, and by the elevation of the specific rotatory power.
Many <i>complex salts</i> are known, the simplest having the<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
composition ThO(C₄H₄O₆R´)₂,8H₂O, where R´ = K,Na,NH₄;
these are obtained by dissolving thorium hydroxide in concentrated
solutions of alkali hydrogen tartrates. <i>Thorium acetylacetone</i>,
Th(C₅H₇O₂)₄, is precipitated by addition of ammonia
to an aqueous solution of the nitrate mixed with acetylacetone
dissolved in ammonia; the solid is recrystallised from
alcohol, and melts at 171°.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Atomic Weight of Thorium.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The value adopted by the
International Committee (1914) is 232·4, but most of the
determinations carried out within the last thirty years show
considerable discrepancies. The earlier work of Berzelius
(1829) and Chydenius (1861) led to very widely varying results,
and for the same reason little reliance can be placed on the
results of Delafontaine (1863) and Hermann (1864). In 1874
Cleve determined the constant by ignition of the sulphate,
obtaining the mean values 234·03 and 233·97; the figure 234
based on these results was for many years accepted as the true
atomic weight. A series of determinations carried out by
Nilson in 1882 led to much lower results. He employed
the sulphate ennea- and octohydrates, first dehydrating these,
and then igniting to oxide, and showed that Cleve’s value
must be too high on account chiefly of the hygroscopic nature
of the ignited oxide, which increases in weight when kept;
but his own values show considerable discrepancies. The
ratio Th(SO₄)₂,9H₂O-ThO₂&nbsp;: ThO₂ (enneahydrate converted
to oxide) gave the figure (corrected to vacuo) 232·51, whilst
the ratio ThO₂&nbsp;: 2SO₃ (anhydrous sulphate to oxide) gave
232·16; the ratio Th(SO₄)₂&nbsp;: 9H₂O (hydrate to anhydrous
salt) gave, however, 233·75. The value obtained for the
ratio ThO₂&nbsp;: 2SO₃ for anhydrous sulphate prepared from the
octohydrate was 232·49 (corrected to vacuo). Five years
later, Krüss and Nilson prepared the anhydrous sulphate
from the pure octohydrate, and ignited this to the oxide.
The ratio ThO₂&nbsp;: 2SO₃ gave as a mean of very concordant
results the figure 232·49.</p>

<p>Brauner criticises these values on the ground that no details
are given as to the temperature required to obtain the anhydrous
salt from the hydrates, and that probably some traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
sulphate must be decomposed at the temperatures required
(450°-500°) to drive off all the water. The results obtained
from the enneahydrate are to a great extent invalidated by
the doubts as to the purity of the hydrate, completeness of
dehydration, etc., which arise from the discrepancies in the
values deduced from the three ratios. He accepts, however,
the figure 232·49 obtained by Nilson and by Krüss and Nilson
from material separated as octohydrate, with some uncertainty
as to the second decimal figure.</p>

<p>Brauner himself employed the oxalate method in 1898;
the purified hexahydrate was used, the percentage of thoria
being determined by ignition, and of (C₂O₃) by titration with
permanganate. The ratio ThO₂&nbsp;: 2C₂O₃ gave results varying
from 232·21 to 232·29, but as the value rose continuously as
purification was carried further and further, he did not feel
justified in taking a mean value. In 1900 Urbain determined
the constant with material purified by the acetylacetone
method. He prepared the octohydrate, heated it for ten hours
in a bath of sulphur vapour at 440°, and ignited the anhydrous
salt so obtained at a white heat. The ratio ThO₂&nbsp;: 2SO₃ gave
the result (corrected to vacuo) Th = 233·67. Brauner criticises
the value on the ground that the hydrated salt was heated in a
vessel open to the air, and that at the high temperature obtained,
traces of moisture gaining access to the sulphate caused hydrolysis,
with loss of sulphuric acid; this would cause the results
to be too high. In 1905 Meyer and Gumperz employed the
same method, and obtained values varying from 232·2 to
232·7, with the mean 232·47. Finally Brauner carried out
an extended investigation to disprove the heterogeneity of
thorium which had been ‘discovered’ by Baskerville (1904),
in the course of which he showed the atomic weight of the
element to lie between the limits 232·34 and 232·52.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Detection of Thorium.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The element is best detected in a
mixture of earths by the following reactions:</p>

<p>(1) Precipitation with hydrogen peroxide from warm,
faintly acid solution.</p>

<p>(2) Precipitation with sodium hypophosphate, Na₂H₂P₂O₆,
in concentrated hydrochloric acid solution. On boiling, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
perceptible precipitate is obtained if only traces of thorium
are present; but ceric and zirconium salts and titanium must
be absent. The latter element gives no precipitate under
these conditions if hydrogen peroxide is present; ceric salts
may be decomposed by boiling. The possible presence of
zirconium renders it necessary to boil the hypophosphate
precipitate with nitric acid; on addition of oxalic acid to
the clear solution, thorium is precipitated, whilst zirconium
remains in solution, and may be detected.</p>

<p>(3) Potassium azide, KN₃, throws down thorium hydroxide
from boiling neutral or faintly acid solutions. Ceric salts if
present must be previously reduced; zirconium must be
previously removed by oxalic acid.</p>

<p>(4) Precipitation may be effected with potassium iodate
in strong nitric acid solution. Here also ceric salts must be
reduced before applying the test. Zirconium also gives the
test; the precipitate must therefore be washed and warmed
with oxalic acid, in which thorium iodate is insoluble, whilst
zirconium iodate is soluble.</p>

THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE ELEMENTS</h2>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XVII</span><br />
THE INCANDESCENT MANTLE INDUSTRY&mdash;HISTORICAL
AND GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The group of elements which we are considering can be divided,
from the point of view of technical application, into two classes.
The first of these contains one element only, titanium, which
in its technology, as in its chemistry, stands apart from the
others; it will, accordingly, be treated in a separate chapter.
The second class contains the yttrium and cerium metals,
with zirconium and thorium; the technical importance of
these elements is due chiefly to the use of their oxides in illumination,
to a small extent in Nernst lamps, and to a much
greater extent in the so-called Incandescent Lighting. The
manufacture of incandescent mantles<a id="FNanchor487"></a><a href="#Footnote487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> is a large and ever-extending
industry, intimately bound up with the older process
of coal-distillation, with its innumerable ramifications; indeed,
it may be said that but for the ingenious invention of Dr. Auer,
illumination by means of coal-gas would to-day have been
almost obsolete. The discovery which resulted in the production
of the familiar incandescent mantle of the present
day may be regarded as the culmination of a century’s effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
to increase the value of coal-gas as an illuminating agent.
In the present chapter it is proposed to outline the history
of these endeavours, and to give a short general account of
Auer’s work and its results.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote487"><a href="#FNanchor487"><span class="label">[487]</span></a>
The term ‘incandescent mantle’ is not, perhaps, scientifically very
desirable. It is used here, not only on account of its general acceptance,
but also because there seems to be no brief and convenient term which might
be used in its stead.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Soon after the introduction of gas as an illuminating agent
it was realised that the luminosity of the flame is dependent
on the presence of solid particles, which by the heat of combustion
of the gas are raised to a temperature at which they
emit radiations of wave-lengths corresponding to the ‘luminous
rays’ of the spectrum. A non-luminous flame of sufficiently
high temperature, therefore, can be rendered luminous by
the introduction of suitable solids, and numberless investigators
have striven, during the past century, to discover
the most suitable method of increasing the luminosity of a
flame in this way. The luminosity of the ordinary ‘bats-wing’
or ‘flat’ flame, now so rapidly going out of use, is due to the
presence in the outer zone of the flame of heated particles of
carbon, produced by the decomposition&mdash;or partial combustion&mdash;of
‘dense’ hydrocarbons, <i>i.e.</i> of hydrocarbons having a
high percentage of carbon. Ordinary coal-gas consists largely
of a mixture of hydrogen and methane, both of which burn
with practically non-luminous flames, with small quantities of
olefines, acetylenes, etc., to which the luminosity is chiefly due.
It would appear, then, that by the introduction of dense
hydrocarbons, a gas of poor illuminating power might be made
much more valuable as a source of light. On the other hand,
it is also apparent that the same end might be achieved by the
introduction into a non-luminous or feebly luminous flame
of an altogether foreign substance, introduced as such, and not
continuously consumed, as is the carbon in the former method.
Both these directions of improvement have been followed;
since, however, the results achieved by the latter method
have become recently of far greater importance, the applications
of the first method will be dismissed quite briefly, and the
history of the second will then be treated somewhat fully.</p>

<p>The first important attempt to increase the illuminating
power of gases burning with feebly luminous flames was that of
Faraday, who in the course of an investigation into the causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
of the variations in luminosity of ‘portable gas,’ discovered
benzene, or bicarburet of hydrogen, as he called it, in 1826.
In 1830 an engineer named Dunnovan undertook to illuminate
Dublin by means of water-gas<a id="FNanchor488"></a><a href="#Footnote488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> which he ‘carburised’ by
addition of dense hydrocarbons. During the latter half of the
nineteenth century this method became of some importance.
It has been applied, in particular, to enrich the ‘natural gas’
of Ohio, North America. The dense hydrocarbons necessary
for this purpose are obtained by the process known as ‘cracking.’
The viscous residues from the distillation of the mineral
oil of the district are allowed to drop into a brick chamber, of
which the walls are raised to a bright red heat, and the dense
hydrocarbons which are evolved are removed by a current
of the gas to be enriched. In this way a gas of relatively
high illuminating power is obtained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote488"><a href="#FNanchor488"><span class="label">[488]</span></a>
Water-gas is a mixture of equal volumes of carbon monoxide and hydrogen,
obtained by blowing steam through a glowing coke furnace. At intervals
the steam is shut off, and air is blown through to raise the temperature of the
coke.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the year previous to that in which Faraday first
carburised water-gas, Berzelius had observed that thoria
and zirconia, when heated in a non-luminous flame, emit
an intense white light. Similar behaviour had long before
been observed in the cases of magnesia, alumina, lime, zinc
oxide, etc. The first practical application of this property
of the oxides was that of Drummond, who in 1826 heated a
pencil of lime in the oxy-hydrogen flame and obtained the
intense white light which has since become so familiar as the
Drummond or ‘lime-light.’ A further development in this
direction was due to du Motay and Maréchal, who in 1867
illuminated the Place de Tuileries and the Hôtel de Ville in
Paris by means of pencils of compressed zirconia&mdash;magnesia
was also used&mdash;heated by means of oil vapour and oxygen.</p>

<p>The use of non-luminous flames to secure illumination, by
raising the temperature of solids suspended in them to the
point of incandescence was proposed in 1839 by Cruickshank,
who used a mantle of platinum wire, covered with lime and
rare earths, which he heated by means of water-gas. In 1846<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
Gillard employed mantles of platinum wire, raised to incandescence
in the flame of burning hydrogen, which he obtained
by passing steam over heated iron wire; later he used water-gas
(1848), his lamps with this modification being employed
in Paris and in Philadelphia. Narbonne was later
illuminated (1856-1865) by a similar device, but permanent
success could hardly be obtained in view of the cost of the
platinum mantles, which lasted only a few months. The
same mantle was proposed in 1882 by Lewis, the ordinary
Bunsen flame being suggested as the source of heat. In the
same year Popp exhibited at the Crystal Palace lamps in which
a platinum mantle was raised to incandescence by means of
a flame of coal-gas and heated air. These attempts, however,
served only to show that no permanent advance could be made
in this direction.</p>

<p>A new development was made in 1880 by Clamond. He
prepared a paste by grinding up calcined and powdered magnesia
with a concentrated solution of magnesium acetate;
by forcing this through a press he obtained a ribbon which was
then wound crosswise on a wooden shaper, dried carefully,
and ignited. In his later experiments twenty per cent. of
zirconia was added to the magnesia. The mantle was supported
in a platinum cage and heated in the flame of a mixture
of coal-gas and heated air. This mantle gave an intense
light, but was too fragile for extended use. In the following
year, Lundgren patented a process by which lime, magnesia,
and zirconia, made into a paste by the addition of gum, were
forced through a press, and the resulting thread wound on a
graphite-covered shaper. The mantle so obtained was stable,
and gave an intense white light, but after having been heated
for some time the oxides crumbled to powder. A modification
of this process was introduced by Knöfler in 1894, in an attempt
to use a cellulose solution containing rare earth salts; this
was forced through jets, and the cellulose precipitated as a
continuous thread from which the mantle was made. A further
modification of Knöfler’s process by Plaisetty in 1901 was
technically successful; but these developments must be taken
up in a later chapter (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page307">p. 307</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span></p>

<p>In 1883 a process was patented by Fahnehjelm in Stockholm,
by which for the first time a cheap and stable mantle of considerable
efficiency was produced, and which, but for the advent
of the Auer mantle, would undoubtedly have been commercially
successful. Fahnehjelm’s mantle consisted of an arrangement
of needles or lamellæ of magnesia, lime, zirconia, etc., suspended
over a burner. The plates and needles were usually arranged
in the form of a comb of suitable shape, and were found to give
an intense light, and to be long-lived. In later forms the combs
were made of rods of magnesia dipped into solutions of chromium
salts. The great disadvantage of this invention lay in the
fact that the combs required to be heated in the flame of water-gas,
in order to secure a good incandescence; had it been
possible to attain a sufficiently high temperature by the use of
coal-gas, it is doubtful whether the Auer mantle would have
ever been evolved.</p>

<p>The more important attempts to secure arrangements
by which the radiations of heated solids could be used for
illumination have now been outlined and the ground cleared
for the consideration of the work of Baron von Welsbach.
There remain yet to be mentioned, however, two attempts
which are of especial interest in view of that work. The
first is that of Frankenstein, who in 1849 made use of a ‘Light-multiplier’
obtained by impregnating gauze with a paste of
chalk and magnesia ground with water. The second is that
of Edison, who proposed (1878) to utilise the observations
of Bahr and Bunsen (1864) and of Delafontaine (1874), of the
remarkable incandescence exhibited by the yttria and erbia
earths, and the terbia earths, respectively, when heated; he
suggested the employment of a mantle of platinum wire covered
with zirconia and the oxides of the rare earth metals, a
proposal similar to that put forward nearly forty years earlier
by Cruickshank.</p>

<p>About the year 1880 Dr. Carl Auer began the study of
the rare earth elements. The chemical aspect of his work has
already been dealt with (<i>vide</i> p. 168); but the results obtained
by the technical application of his observation that threads
of cotton, impregnated with a solution of salts of the elements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
leave after ignition a coherent ash of oxide, which glows brightly
when heated, have been of far greater importance than the
purely scientific aspect, valuable though that is. A series of
experiments soon showed that a fabric of suitable shape,
impregnated with a solution of nitrates or acetates of the
rare earth elements, after being dried and drawn together
at one end by means of a platinum wire, can be ignited in a
Bunsen flame in such a way as to leave a coherent skeleton
of the earth oxides, which can be formed and hardened by
suitable manipulation with a high temperature burner; the
mantle so prepared, when suspended from a lateral support in a
Bunsen flame, gives a light of considerable intensity, the colour
varying with the oxides employed from green to orange tints.</p>

<p>The earlier mantles, which were placed on the market
about 1883, consisted chiefly of oxides of lanthanum and
zirconium, with smaller quantities of the other oxides, selected
according to the shade of light desired. These mantles were
protected by patents taken out in France in 1884, and in
Germany in 1885 and the following years. The process<a id="FNanchor489"></a><a href="#Footnote489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
was briefly the following: A vegetable fibre, of cylindrical form,
woven from threads of about 0·22 mm. diameter, is washed
with dilute hydrochloric acid, then with distilled water, and
impregnated with a 30 per cent. solution of the selected salts.
The fabric is then wrung out and dried, and cut into suitable
lengths, allowance being made for subsequent shrinkage.
One end of each cylinder is then drawn together by means of a
platinum wire, and the mantle hung from a side support over
a burner and incinerated. The head is then treated with a
solution of aluminium and magnesium nitrates (beryllium
nitrate and the corresponding phosphates are also specified) to
strengthen it, and the mantle dried, and ‘formed’ by means
of a very hot flame. This first patent protected several
definite mixtures of salts, chosen so that the mantle should
emit light of a definite known tint. The chief oxides employed
were lanthana, yttria, magnesia, and zirconia. A German
patent granted in 1886<a id="FNanchor490"></a><a href="#Footnote490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
protects the use of thorium salts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>
and a long list of salts of the elements with numerous acids;
an important advance mentioned in this specification is the
process of collodinisation of the finished mantle, by dipping
in a solution of rubber in benzene or of collodion (cellulose
nitrate) in ether and alcohol, which renders the product strong
enough for transport. From 1885 to 1891 numerous improvements
were effected; asbestos threads were substituted
for platinum wire, central rods of magnesia replaced the
lateral platinum support, and various mixtures of oxides were
tried. None of the innumerable mixtures employed, however,
was successful in establishing the struggling industry on a
firm basis in face of the vigorous competition of the electric
lamp, and it was not till 1891 that the introduction of the
final ‘Auer Mixture,’ which is in use at the present day, gave
the welcome assurance of a certain success to von Welsbach
and his assistants. The discovery of this mixture was a result
of the examination of a quantity of impure thoria; it was
found that mantles made from the nitrate gave a light which
steadily decreased in intensity as the impurities were removed.
It needed only the observation that the impurities consisted
chiefly of cerium compounds to turn the long and arduous
investigation in the direction of final success, and our present
mantles, which consist approximately of 99 per cent. thoria
and 1 per cent. ceria, were placed on the market in 1891,
the composition being announced by patent in 1893.<a id="FNanchor491"></a><a href="#Footnote491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>The effect of increasing or decreasing the ratio of the two
oxides, and the theories which have been advanced to account
for the results, must be referred to in a later chapter (<i>vide</i>
<a href="#Page294">p. 294</a>). It may be mentioned here, however, that practically
no other known mixture gives such satisfactory results,
though mantles have been manufactured of alumina with small
quantities of chromic oxide, and ‘inverted’ mantles made
of these oxides with zirconia have recently been advocated by
Professor Lewes,<a id="FNanchor492"></a><a href="#Footnote492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> an authority on gas lighting. Mixtures of
alumina and uranium oxide have also been patented, but no
mantles appear to have been manufactured according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
specifications. In this connection, also, may be mentioned
the various attempts to evade the Auer patents by taking
advantage of the ‘discovery’ of ‘new’ elements. One
enterprising firm, after having an account of a ‘new’ element,
Lucium, inserted in a well-known scientific periodical, put salts
on the market, and proceeded to manufacture mantles from
what were proved by analysis to be cerium compounds. Similar
‘new’ elements were Russium, Kosmium, and Neo-kosmium,
names which covered various mixtures of thorium and cerium
compounds with other salts.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>After the introduction in 1891 of the final Auer mixture,
progress became rapid. The original mantles, made from
cotton, had many disadvantages; thus after being in use for
some time they were found to shrink considerably, with marked
decrease in strength and light-giving power. Once the success
of the new form of lighting was assured, numberless investigations
were undertaken to lengthen the life and increase the
efficiency of the mantles. The most important of these were
connected with the endeavour to replace cotton by some fabric
which on ignition would leave the oxide skeleton in a harder,
more coherent and more elastic condition. The first great
advance in this connection was the introduction of Ramie fibre
by Buhlmann in 1898. Ramie, China-grass, or grass-cloth, as
it is sometimes termed, is a fabric made from the fibres of
the tschuma plant of the Yang-tse-kiang valley and other parts
of Asia; mantles made from it last longer and maintain their
efficiency much better than the earlier cotton mantles, which
they have very largely displaced. The use of artificial silk was
patented by De Mare in 1894, but his process was unworkable;
it was an effort to adapt to the purposes of incandescent lighting
the nitro-cellulose process introduced by Chardonnet in 1890
for the manufacture of artificial silk. In 1897 De Lery and in
1900 Plaisetty made further efforts in this direction, and
finally in 1902-1903 the latter worked out a process by which
mantles were made directly from the spun fabric. These
mantles are superior in every way to the earlier ramie or cotton
kinds, and are rapidly coming into general use, especially for
lamps using high-pressure gas. Numberless patents for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
manufacture and improvement of this kind of mantle have
been taken out during the last ten years; the most important
of these will be dealt with in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to secure greater strength and
toughness in mantles in other directions also. The use of
metallic wires in the fibre has been suggested; numerous
patents deal with mantles ‘strengthened’ by doubling the
thread at intervals, and by special methods of weaving the fibre.
One method, which follows on the lines of Glamond and Lundgren,
proposes<a id="FNanchor493"></a><a href="#Footnote493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> the use of mantles made from various oxides
mixed with silica, the whole being worked into a paste by use
of a gum or soap, from which threads are prepared by pressure;
mantles made from these threads are said to be very strong
and porous. Another patent<a id="FNanchor494"></a><a href="#Footnote494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> protects the manufacture of
‘incandescence bodies’ made from plates or combs prepared
from a thread obtained in a rather similar way. A third of
these innumerable suggestions recommends a preliminary
impregnation of the fabric with an aluminium or magnesium
salt,<a id="FNanchor495"></a><a href="#Footnote495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> from which the oxide is precipitated on the fabric by
a suitable means, impregnation with the ordinary ‘lighting
fluid’ being effected after drying. Quite an early
patent<a id="FNanchor496"></a><a href="#Footnote496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> proposes
the impregnation of the prepared mantle, either after or
just before burning off, with an alcoholic solution of an organic
silicon compound, so that when the mantle is in use a skeleton
of silica is formed to ‘strengthen’ the oxide ash. No useful
purpose can be served by extending the list of these proposals;
enough has been said to indicate the various directions in which
so many vain attempts at improvement have been made.</p>

<p>From the mechanical and physical side the recent developments
have been very marked. The introduction of the
‘inverted’ lamp was a tremendous step forward, and paved the
way to the second great improvement, the use of ‘high-pressure’
gas, with which such successful results are being obtained. The
form of lamp now coming into use for street lighting gives 1500<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
candle-power per mantle, and usually carries three mantles;
each lamp thus develops 4500 candle-power. The purely
mechanical devices which are now used to secure ‘automatic’
lighting are rapidly bringing this form of lamp into favour
for street illumination. A full account of these developments
would be entirely beyond the scope of the present work. In
the following chapters, therefore, no complete treatment of
the incandescent lighting industry can be given; but whilst
the chemical aspect is treated at some length, many points
of more purely technical character, which are connected with
this, have also been included.</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XVIII</span><br />
THE CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF MONAZITE</h3>

<p>It has been stated in the previous chapter that the first Auer
mantles were made of mixtures of various rare earth oxides,
the mixture of thoria with 1 per cent. of ceria being first
employed in October, 1891. The impetus given to the mantle
industry by the success of the new mixture caused an immediate
demand for thoria, which was at that time extracted from
thorite (see <a href="#Page43">p. 43</a>). A ‘thorite-fever’ broke out along the
coasts of Scandinavia, and the price of orangite rose to 600
marks per kilogram (about £13 10<i>s.</i> per pound avoirdupois),
sinking again shortly to 80 marks<a id="FNanchor497"></a><a href="#Footnote497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
(about £1 16<i>s.</i> per lb). The
discovery of the monazite sands of the Carolinas and Brazil,
which at the present rate of consumption may be considered
to be, for all practical purposes, inexhaustible, placed the
industry on a firm basis, and the pure monazite, extracted
from these deposits by the methods outlined in Chapter VII,
is now almost the sole source of the thorium nitrate of commerce.
Small quantities are obtained from thorianite, the separation
of the pure material presenting, in this case, very little difficulty
by reason of the solubility of the mineral in acids and the very
high percentage of thoria.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote497"><a href="#FNanchor497"><span class="label">[497]</span></a> <i>Vide</i>
Böhm, ‘Die Thorium Industrie,’ <i>Chem. Ind.</i> 1906, <b>29</b>, 450 and 488.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The extraction of pure thorium compounds from monazite is a
process of very great technical difficulty. The percentage of thoria
is small, whereas that of the ceria oxides is high. The mineral
is almost always decomposed by heating with concentrated
sulphuric acid, and when the resulting pasty mass is taken up
with water, a large amount of free sulphuric acid must be
present in order to hold the rare earth phosphates in solution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span>
For the separation of thoria from ceria and yttria compounds
in acid solution no processes were known until quite recently.
When it is remembered that the thorium nitrate used for the
manufacture of mantles must be of a degree of purity which
very few commercial products ever approach, some idea of the
difficulties of the extraction may be obtained.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Decomposition of the Monazite.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Two processes have been
used for the working up of monazite. The first of these consists
in fusing the mineral with soda, and extracting the sodium
phosphate with water; the earths may then be taken into
solution with acid, and the separation effected as outlined
below. This method is very rarely used. A process has been
proposed, in which the monazite is fused with carbon in an
electric furnace; the cooled mass is treated with mineral
acids, which take the earths into solution free from phosphoric
acid. No technical application has so far been made of this
proposal.</p>

<p>The method commonly used is that in which the sand is
decomposed by means of sulphuric acid. The charge usually
employed, about two to three hundred kilograms, requires
from four to six hours’ heating, about twice the weight of
concentrated acid being needed. The operation is carried
out in cast-iron vessels, and an efficient draught must be maintained
to remove the acid fumes; the factories are usually
isolated. The treatment with sulphuric acid converts the
phosphates chiefly into sulphates; when the reaction is finished,
the liquor fumes strongly and begins to thicken, heating being
stopped when a thick broth is obtained. The cooled mass is
extracted with water, care being taken to maintain a degree
of acidity sufficient to prevent any precipitation of the
phosphates.</p>

<p>It has been already stated in Part I (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page73">p. 73</a>) that a
strongly radioactive product. Radiothorium, has been obtained
from the mineral thorianite. This body is produced
by the atomic degradation of thorium, and an intermediate
body, mesothorium, has been found to be formed during the
change. Mesothorium is a substance which, though it appears
to be chemically identical with radium, has an activity equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
to three hundred times that of radium, and when in equilibrium
with its degradation products the ‘rays’ it emits are very
similar to those of the latter element. Since mesothorium
is a degradation-product of thorium, it occurs in minute
quantities in all thorium minerals, and by reason of the possibility
of using it as a substitute for radium, its extraction
becomes a matter of importance. Soddy<a id="FNanchor498"></a><a href="#Footnote498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> has shown that if a
barium compound be added to monazite before the treatment
with sulphuric acid, the mesothorium remains with the barium
sulphate; this is readily separated from the heavy unchanged
grains of sand, and is purified, and finally obtained as
chloride by treating the solution with hydrogen chloride. On
recrystallisation of the barium chloride, the active products are
concentrated in the less soluble part, and it is possible to
prepare on the commercial scale a mixture which, though it
contains only 0·25 per cent. of mesothorium, has an activity
equal to that of pure radium bromide. This mixture contains
25 per cent. of radium compounds, radium being present as
an original constituent of monazite; owing to the chemical
identity of radium and mesothorium,<a href="#Footnote498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> the latter cannot be
separated, but Soddy, by removal of much of the barium
compound in the laboratory, has obtained a product four times
as active as the pure radium salt.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is probable that the treatment of monazite will in the
future be modified by the addition of barium sulphate before
the sulphuric acid decomposition, to allow of the commercial
extraction of its mesothorium.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Separation of Thorium.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The separation of a crude
thorium product from the acid solution obtained after decomposition
of the mineral can be effected in two ways, both of
which are based on the fact that thoria is less basic than the
oxides of the cerium and yttrium metals. In the first, the rare
earth elements, including thorium, are precipitated as oxalates
by the addition of oxalic acid to the acid solution. These
are again taken into solution by the action of hydrochloric
acid on the hydroxides, obtained by prolonged digestion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
oxalates with sodium hydroxide; the acid solution is then
treated carefully with sodium hydroxide, or pure powdered
magnesia, until about one-sixth of the bases has been precipitated,
the liquid being constantly stirred. Thorium hydroxide
being very weakly basic is precipitated before the other
hydroxides, and the precipitate obtained, after one or two repetitions,
contains most of the thorium originally present in the
monazite. In the second process, thorium is partially separated
from the other metals by adding gradually to the solution
obtained after the treatment of the mineral with sulphuric acid,
the quantity of magnesia calculated to precipitate a suitable
fraction of the earths, with constant stirring; this throws down
a mixture of phosphates containing almost all the thorium and
some of the other elements. The slimy phosphate precipitate
is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the earths precipitated
as oxalates; the precipitate must be washed thoroughly in
order to remove phosphoric acid. It will be seen that these
two methods differ only in that in the first the phosphoric
acid is removed before the precipitation of thorium, whereas
in the second the thorium is precipitated as phosphate, and
this transformed into oxalate.</p>

<p>Quite recently, methods have been proposed by which
the thorium can be separated in a fairly pure condition from
the acid solution obtained from the sulphuric acid treatment.
Rosenheim, Meyer and Koppel<a id="FNanchor499"></a><a href="#Footnote499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> protect the use of hydrofluosilicic
acid (H₂SiF₆), and its salts, for this purpose. The
sodium salt, added to the hot acid liquid, produces a quantitative
separation of thorium silicofluoride; the precipitate is
washed by decantation, and treated with sulphuric acid, the
thorium sulphate being then purified directly by the sulphate
method described below. A second method proposes to
make use of the insolubility of thorium hypophosphate,
ThP₂O₆,11H₂O, which was found by Kaufmann in 1899 to
be insoluble in water, and in acids and alkalies. This
method has already been in use for some years for analytical
work;<a id="FNanchor500"></a><a href="#Footnote500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
it appears to be readily susceptible of adaptation<span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span>
for the technical extraction,<a id="FNanchor501"></a><a href="#Footnote501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> the sodium hypophosphate,
Na₂H₂P₂O₆,6H₂O required as the precipitating agent being
obtainable in large quantities by the electrolytic oxidation of
copper phosphide, employed as the anode in an electrolytic cell.<a id="FNanchor502"></a><a href="#Footnote502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
This method also gives a thorium compound sufficiently free
from other earths to be subjected at once to the refining
process; the hypophosphate has in fact been suggested as a very
suitable compound for the impregnation of artificial silk mantles
directly. The thorium nitrate of commerce, however, is still
prepared almost entirely from the crude product obtained by
one or other of the two methods of fractional precipitation
first described, so that it becomes necessary to outline the
method generally employed for separating from this a compound
pure enough to be suitable for the final refining
process.</p>

<p>The crude oxalate or hydroxide is thoroughly digested
with a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate. The
carbonates of the cerium elements are much less soluble in
sodium carbonate solution than is thorium carbonate. After
thorough digestion the liquid is filtered from the undissolved
carbonates. The thorium is reprecipitated from the filtrate,
either as oxalate, by the addition of hydrochloric acid (if the
crude material was in the form of oxalate), or as hydroxide,
by the addition of sodium hydroxide. The process is again
repeated, and a final digestion is then made with ammonium
carbonate; addition of an alkali to the clear filtrate now gives
thorium hydroxide sufficiently pure to be used for the last
refining.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Purification of the Thorium Compounds.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The object of
this last stage is to remove from the thorium compound small
quantities of cerium and yttrium salts which cannot be
separated by the carbonate method. The chief process is the
sulphate crystallisation, the principles underlying which have
been thoroughly examined in the patient researches of Koppel
and Holtkamp.<a id="FNanchor503"></a><a href="#Footnote503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
Since the process is based on the solubilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
of the various thorium sulphate hydrates, it is necessary to
consider these in some detail.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The solubility-curve of thorium sulphate was examined
by Demarçay and by Roozeboom. Three important hydrates
are known, viz. Th(SO₄)₂,9H₂O, Th(SO₄)₂,8H₂O, and
Th(SO₄)₂,4H₂O, other unstable intermediate compounds being
said to exist. From a study of the diagram it will be
seen that the hydrate with 8 molecules of water is labile,
whilst the 9-hydrate and the 4-hydrate have a transition
temperature at 43°C., the transition temperature of the
8-hydrate and the 4-hydrate being just below this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig10">

<img src="images/illo280.png" alt="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span></p>

</div>

<p>Since the 8-hydrate is labile with regard to the 9-hydrate,
and the transition temperatures are so near, the former will
be formed first as a solution cools, and by reason of the great
similarity of the solubility-curves for the 9- and 8-hydrates
the rate of change of this to the 9-hydrate will be very slow.
In practice, therefore, it is always the 8-hydrate which is formed,
and it is on the separation of this compound that the success
of the process depends. The anhydro-compound, Th(SO₄)₂,<span class="pagenum" id="Page281">[281]</span>
which can be obtained by heating any of the hydrates to
300°-400°C., is very soluble at 0°, but slowly hydrates itself
and separates from the solution as the 8-hydrate, which has
a very low solubility. The sulphates of the cerium metals,
compounds of which form the chief impurities to be removed,
are considerably more soluble, and can be separated by repeated
crystallisations.</p>

<p>The thorium hydroxide to be purified is dissolved in sulphuric
acid, and in the first form in which the method was employed,
the thorium sulphate obtained by evaporation of the solvent
was heated until it became anhydrous. This was dissolved to
saturation at 0°, and the solution raised to the boiling-point,
the 4-hydrate being precipitated; this treatment was repeated
several times. It was pointed out by Bunsen, from theoretical
grounds, that this method could never yield a pure thorium
salt, and Krüss and Nilson accordingly introduced a modification.
The impure sulphate, after dehydration, as before, is
dissolved at 0°, and allowed to come to ordinary room temperature,
20°; the hydrate which separates (the 8-hydrate) is
collected and dried at high temperature and the crystallisation
repeated. This method gives a fairly pure salt after three
recrystallisations, but the process is very tedious, owing to the
time required for drying and heating the hydrate. For this
reason the method was further modified by Cleve and Witt.
The crude sulphate is boiled with ammonia, and the hydroxide
obtained dissolved in hydrochloric acid; addition of sulphuric
acid to the concentrated solution in the cold transforms the
chloride into the sulphate, which separates as the 8-hydrate
at ordinary temperatures. Three repetitions give a satisfactory
product, and in this form the method is now much used.</p>

<p>The work of Koppel and Holtkamp referred to above has
placed the process on a sound basis. These authors have
examined the solubilities of the various hydrates in presence
of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric acids, and mixtures of
these, at different temperatures. They find that hydrochloric
acid is to be preferred to nitric acid, in the process of Cleve
and Witt, as besides its lower price, its use involves less loss
than that of the latter acid; excess of hydrochloric acid<span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span>
is not harmful within wide limits, whilst a slight excess of sulphuric
acid over the quantity required to form the sulphate
is desirable, to secure the greatest yield. Finally, the temperature
at the addition of the sulphuric acid must not be allowed
to rise above 25°, for in the presence of so much acid the
transition temperature to the 4-hydrate, normally 42°, is
considerably lowered; it is necessary to avoid separation of
the 4-hydrate, which is a flocculent unworkable precipitate.</p>

<p>Recently it has been proposed to carry out the purification
by use of alkyl hydrogen sulphates,<a id="FNanchor504"></a><a href="#Footnote504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> as it is stated that the
differences of solubilities of the alkyl sulphates of thorium
and the cerium metals are greater than in the case of the
sulphates themselves. It is also claimed that the presence of a
small quantity of the alkyl sulphate in the thorium nitrate
which forms the final product has a good effect on the quality
of the mantles made from it.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Another process of purification which has found considerable
commercial application is the acetate crystallisation, thorium
acetate being considerably less soluble than the acetates of the
cerium elements. The impure hydroxide is dissolved in acetic
acid and the solution evaporated to dryness; repeated washing
with small quantities of water removes the cerium acetates, and
a fairly pure salt is obtained. This is repeatedly damped with
nitric acid and heated to dryness, but even after this treatment a
certain amount of unchanged thorium acetate is usually present.</p>

<p>In a second form of this method, due to Haber, the impure
hydroxide is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the acetate
precipitated by addition of sodium acetate. The precipitate
is filtered off and re-dissolved in acid, and the acetate again
thrown down by means of sodium acetate. The precipitate is
then dissolved in nitric acid, and the solution evaporated to
dryness. In this form the method gives very good results, even
from a comparatively crude product; but the process is, of course,
considerably more expensive than the sulphate purification.</p>

<p>The high price of the necessary reagents, again, is a bar
to the technical application of the very simple and efficient
process of Wyrouboff and Verneuil. These authors suggest<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
the precipitation of thorium peroxide from a warm dilute neutral
solution by means of hydrogen peroxide, a process which is
quantitative and yields a very pure product. The last traces
of the cerium metals can be completely removed by a second
precipitation. The cost of hydrogen peroxide is too high,
however, to allow its employment on such a large scale,
and the method has not, in consequence, come into general
use.</p>

<p>The thorium nitrate obtained after purification by the
sulphate method, or by the less generally employed acetate
method, is usually considered sufficiently pure for technical
purposes. Even now, however, it may contain traces of
sulphate, of iron, of alkalies, and of cerium metals. If absolute
purity is desired, the salt may be dissolved, and freed
from all impurities, except the cerium compounds, by precipitation
with ammonium oxalate and thorough washing;
the oxalate may then be dissolved in chromic acid, and potassium
chromate solution added drop by drop; the precipitated
thorium chromate is nearly free from other rare earth compounds,
and repetition of the process will give a pure salt.
The separation from cerium metals may also be effected
by the hydrogen peroxide process. If the technical processes
are carefully carried out, however, a thorium nitrate of a
very high degree of purity may be obtained, and the laboratory
purification need only be undertaken if material is needed
for very accurate quantitative work.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Preparation of Thorium Nitrate from Mantle-ash.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Since
the ordinary incandescent mantle, in use, consists only of the
pure thoria and ceria, with small quantities of alumina, lime, and
magnesia, which have been employed to strengthen the ‘head,’
the working-up of mantle-ash gives an easy means of obtaining
the nitrates, and high prices are accordingly paid for the ash
in quantity. At one period of great competition between
rival manufacturers, canvassers went from house to house in
many large towns buying up mantle residues, to be used for
the extraction of the thorium for ‘lighting-fluid.’</p>

<p>For this purpose, the oxides are treated with hot concentrated
sulphuric acid, the cooled residue dissolved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span>
water, and the thorium and cerium precipitated free from
compounds of aluminium, magnesium, and calcium by oxalic
acid. If pure thorium nitrate, free from cerium, is required,
the oxalates are added to the last precipitate from the double
carbonate purification in the <a href="#Page275">treatment of monazite</a> (<i>vide
supra</i>), and the ordinary processes of refinement continued;
more often, however, the mixed nitrate for impregnation of
the mantle-fabric is required, and this is obtained by ignition
of the oxalates and solution of the oxides so obtained in nitric
acid, more cerium nitrate being added if necessary.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Extraction of Cerium Nitrate.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Since monazite is primarily
a phosphate of the cerium metals, the percentage of thoria
being usually quite low (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Ref59">Monazite</a>, <a href="#Page82">Chapter VI</a>), very large
quantities of compounds of the cerium group of elements
are annually produced in the process of extraction of thorium.
There is at present a very limited demand for these compounds
(<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page313">Chapter XXI</a>), no important uses having yet been
found for them. In the ordinary process of extraction of the
thorium, these elements remain as the sparingly soluble double
carbonates, whilst the thorium double carbonate is removed in
solution. From the mixed salts which contain 50-60 per cent.
of the cerium compound, the cerium nitrate required for the
manufacture of mantles is prepared, but the amount so
used is a small fraction of the whole, and large quantities
of compounds of cerium and the allied elements are available
as soon as profitable uses can be found.</p>

<p>Three processes are in general use for the preparation of
cerium nitrate from the mixed carbonates; all of these are
based on the fact that cerium can become tetravalent, forming
in this condition compounds which can readily be separated
from those of the allied elements, which can be obtained only
in the trivalent condition. When ceria is dissolved in hot
nitric acid, ceric nitrate, Ce(NO₃)₄, is formed, though the action
of nitric acid on cerous carbonate or oxalate gives rise to cerous
nitrate. Two of the three processes are based on this reaction,
and for these the mixed carbonates are dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, freed from foreign elements by precipitation with oxalic
acid, and the oxalates ignited to the oxides, which are then<span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span>
dissolved in the required quantity of nitric acid. In the first
process the cerium is precipitated from this solution by merely
pouring it into a large excess of very dilute nitric acid, when a
yellow basic ceric nitrate is precipitated; this is washed with
dilute nitric acid by decantation, dissolved in concentrated
acid, and purified by a second precipitation in the same way. In
the second process, separation is effected by addition to the nitric
acid solution of the calculated quantity of ammonium nitrate;
the solution is concentrated to incipient crystallisation, and on
cooling the double ceric ammonium nitrate, Ce(NO₃)₄,2NH₄NO₃,
separates. This is collected, washed with dilute nitric acid,
and recrystallised until a pure salt is obtained. The double
nitrate can be readily decomposed by ignition, leaving ceria,
which is dissolved in nitric acid; the nitrate is obtained by
evaporation.</p>

<p>The third method, due to Drossbach, is based on the oxidation
of cerium salts in neutral solution by potassium permanganate.
The mixed carbonates are dissolved in hydrochloric
acid, a further quantity of the carbonates stirred in, to neutralise
excess of acid, and a solution of the required quantity of
potassium permanganate added. The reaction is said to proceed
according to the equation:</p>

<p class="equation">3Ce₂O₃ + 2KMnO₄ + H₂O = 6CeO₂ + 2KOH + 2MnO₂</p>

<p class="noindent">The precipitated solid is separated, and dissolved in acid; the
cerium is then precipitated as the oxalate, which is transformed
into nitrate in the usual way. The solution contains the other
elements of the cerium group, which are precipitated by means of
sodium hydroxide. The yield obtained by this method is very
good, practically the whole of the cerium being separated
without loss; whilst it has the further advantage that the
remaining elements of the group can be precipitated at once
after the separation.</p>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Analysis of a Monazite or Monazite Sand for Thorium.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Since
the commercial value of a monazite sand or concentrate,
or of the pure mineral, depends, at present, entirely on the
percentage of thoria, it is important to have a rapid and reliable
method of estimating this constituent. The only reliable<span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span>
methods of quantitatively decomposing the mineral, however,
all involve acid treatment, and excess of acid must always be
present to prevent precipitation of phosphates. Until recently,
no way was known for estimating thorium in an acid solution,
and all the earlier methods therefore involved tedious processes
for complete removal of phosphoric acid, so that the salts could
be obtained in neutral solution. This was usually effected
by precipitation of the whole rare earth content with oxalic
acid, and thorough washing of the oxalates; these can then be
dissolved directly in fuming nitric acid on the water-bath, or
ignited to the oxides, which may then be dissolved in the same
reagent. The solution of nitrates is evaporated to dryness,
to effect removal of the excess of acid, the nitrates dissolved
in water, and the thorium estimated in the neutral solution.</p>

<p>Among the earliest methods employed for the estimation
in neutral solution was the thiosulphate precipitation.<a id="FNanchor505"></a><a href="#Footnote505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
Thorium thiosulphate is not known; when sodium thiosulphate
is added to a neutral solution of a thorium salt, a precipitate
of thoria mixed with sulphur is obtained, by hydrolysis of the
potential thiosulphate, and decomposition of the unstable
thiosulphuric acid. The method, however, leaves much to be
desired; other earths are partly precipitated, and the separation
of thoria is not complete. For analytical purposes the
precipitate obtained is redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and a
second precipitation with thiosulphate effected. The filtrates
from the two precipitations are collected, and the whole earth-content
precipitated from these with ammonia; the hydroxides
are dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and again treated with
thiosulphate to throw down any thoria which has escaped the
previous precipitations. The three precipitates of thoria
are then collected, dried, and ignited for weighing as pure
thorium dioxide, ThO₂.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote505"><a href="#FNanchor505"><span class="label">[505]</span></a>
Full accounts of this and the two following methods will be found in an
important paper by Benz, <i>Zeitsch. angew. Chem.</i> 1902, <b>15</b>, 297</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Even more tedious and unsatisfactory is the method based
on the solubility of thorium oxalate in excess of ammonium
oxalate in neutral solution. The solution is boiled, ammonium
oxalate added, and after some moments a small quantity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
ammonium acetate solution. On cooling, the oxalates of the
cerium metals separate, and can be collected; thoria is precipitated
from the filtrate by addition of ammonia. The process
must be repeated two or three times, the solution being allowed
to stand for one or two days each time, and finally the thoria
must be precipitated by thiosulphate to remove traces of the
other bases before it can be weighed. Benz (<i>loc. cit.</i>) gives
a complete account of this method, and quotes numerous
analyses carried out to test its accuracy.</p>

<p>Far more satisfactory than either of the above is the peroxide
method used by de Boisbaudran and Cleve, and later by
Wyrouboff and Verneuil.<a id="FNanchor506"></a><a href="#Footnote506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Thorium is completely precipitated
as a ‘peroxide salt’ (Th₂O₇,SO₃ or Th₂O₇,N₂O₅ respectively) from
warm neutral solutions of the sulphate or nitrate on addition
of dilute hydrogen peroxide, a second precipitation being
necessary to free it from cerium compounds. Wyrouboff
and Verneuil state that the process is rendered difficult by the
fact that the peroxide cannot be converted into the dioxide
by heating, either alone or with acids, as decrepitation takes
place and may cause loss; they accordingly reduce the compound
in presence of hydrochloric acid by ammonium iodide,
and precipitate thorium hydroxide by ammonia. Benz (<i>loc.
cit.</i>) does not find this difficulty; he states that small quantities
of the peroxide dissolve easily in acids without loss, and further
finds that if an ammonium salt be added to the neutral solution
of the thorium compound before addition of hydrogen peroxide,
the precipitate forms much more readily and is very easily
handled. Borelli<a id="FNanchor507"></a><a href="#Footnote507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> states that the precipitated peroxide can
be ignited without loss to the dioxide, and weighed as this.</p>

<p>Numberless experiments have been made with organic
acids in the hope that an easy method of separation might be
found, but though some useful results have been obtained,
precipitation has always to be effected in neutral solution, so
that all such processes involve the tedious preliminary work of
which an outline has been given above. Metzger<a id="FNanchor509"></a><a href="#Footnote509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> finds that
a quantitative separation of thorium can be effected from
a solution in 40 per cent. alcohol by use of fumaric acid; a
second precipitation is needed to secure the complete removal
of the cerium elements. Neish<a id="FNanchor510"></a><a href="#Footnote510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> uses meta-nitrobenzoic acid,
which precipitates the thorium salt from a boiling solution;
cerium earths, if present, are carried down in small quantities,
and are removed by dissolving the precipitate in dilute nitric
acid, adding a further quantity of the organic acid, and treating
carefully with ammonia to almost complete neutralisation.
The compound obtained by this second precipitation is the
pure thorium salt. More recently, Smith and James<a id="FNanchor511"></a><a href="#Footnote511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> have
shown that sebacic acid gives a quantitative precipitation of
the thorium salt, from boiling neutral solution, as a voluminous
granular precipitate, readily filtered and washed; sebacic acid
is very sparingly soluble in cold water, but dissolves readily
at 100°, and since, in virtue of this property, it can be readily
recovered after use, the authors suggest it as a suitable reagent
for the technical separation of thorium from monazite. In all
cases where thorium is precipitated as an organic salt in quantitative
analysis, the precipitate is dried and ignited, and the
residue weighed as the pure dioxide.</p>

If pure moist lead carbonate be stirred into a neutral solution
of rare earth compounds, thoria is completely precipitated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span>
Only the tetravalent elements are separated by this method,
so that if ceric compounds are present, they must first be
reduced by means of sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphur dioxide;
zirconium, if present, must afterwards be separated from the
thorium. One precipitation is said to ensure almost complete
separation from the trivalent elements. The precipitate
is collected, washed, and dissolved in hydrochloric acid; after
filtering, if necessary, the solution is saturated with sulphuretted
hydrogen, to ensure complete removal of the lead, and thorium
hydroxide is then precipitated by ammonia. The drawback
to this method lies probably in the fact that it is necessary
to use absolutely pure lead carbonate, a substance which, as
the author’s elaborate process of purification seems to show,
could not be obtained very cheaply on a large scale.</p>

thrown down under these conditions, the hydroxide is dissolved
in hydrochloric acid; pure thorium oxalate is precipitated from
this solution by oxalic acid, and is ignited and weighed as oxide,

with a mixture of sulphuric and fuming nitric acids; the phosphates
produced by the oxidation are freed from nitric acid

acid, and thorium precipitated as the oxalate, which is then
ignited as usual. This method has been suggested for the

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XIX</span><br />
THE MANUFACTURE OF MANTLES FROM COTTON
AND RAMIE</h3>

<p>The fabric chosen for the manufacture of the original Welsbach
mantles was a specially selected cotton, woven from threads
of a specified thickness. The oxide skeleton left after burning
off the impregnated fabric, however, showed many serious
defects. Gradual shrinkage occurred during use, so that the
mantle was gradually withdrawn from the hottest zone of the
flame; the contraction also resulted in crumpling, which caused
the fragile fabric to fall to pieces. The light-giving power
showed a gradual but continuous diminution, so that after a
hundred hours, the decrease sometimes amounted to thirty per
cent. of the original intensity. Lastly, owing to the fragility
due to the torsion introduced by the twisting together of so
many short fibres in the spinning of the fabric, the life of these
mantles was very short, and their susceptibility to shock very
great.</p>

<p>With the introduction of ramie, many of these defects
disappeared. Mantles made from this fibre do not shrink continuously,
nor to any considerable extent, so that crumpling
does not occur; the decrease in light-giving power is very much
less than with the cotton mantles, the life is much longer,
and the resistance to shock very much greater. Microscopic
examination of the fibres, and of the ash left after burning
off, shows that these differences are traceable to differences
in the mechanical structure of the two fabrics. The cotton
thread is spun from a very large number of very short fibres,
which are twisted together, whereas the separate fibres of
ramie are of much greater length, and the torsion in the thread<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
correspondingly less. In the case of artificial silk, continuous
filaments are spun into threads, and this simple fact accounts
for the very much greater durability and elasticity of mantles
made from this fabric.</p>

<p>The introduction of ramie for the manufacture of mantles
effected no great alterations in the processes employed in the
case of cotton; the treatment of artificial silk, however, requires
a profoundly modified method, and in consequence the preparation
of this fabric and the manufacture of mantles from it,
are considered separately in <a href="#Page301">another chapter</a>. Though the
manufacture of artificial silk was first commenced in France,
it is in Germany that its adaptation to the incandescent mantle
industry has been successfully effected. Its adoption, however,
has not yet become general, and by far the greatest number of
mantles are to-day made from ramie. In the United States,
where the early working of the monazite deposits gave a great
impetus to the industry, the manufacturers still cling largely
to the older methods, so that even now quite a considerable
number of mantles are made from cotton.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, a short account will be given of
the methods employed in the manufacture of mantles from
ramie and cotton. The general methods of preparation of
cotton fabrics are well known. Ramie is prepared from the
tschuma plant, which is found in India, China, and other parts
of Asia. The fibre is obtained from the inner side of the
bark; this is dried, pressed into bales, and exported. After
removal of gum and resin, by heating with sodium hydroxide
solution under pressure, the fibre is bleached, dried and cleaned,
and then combed and spun in the usual manner.<a id="FNanchor517"></a><a href="#Footnote517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<h4 class="inline"><b>Washing.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The influence of even small quantities of
impurities on the intensity of the light emitted by a mantle
is remarkably great, and the manufacture requires a degree
of care and attention far beyond that needed in ordinary
technical processes. Washing of the fabric in particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
must be very thorough and careful, if a mantle of reasonable
quality is required. If the mineral content of the fabric,
<i>i.e.</i> the ash left on incineration, amount to more than 0·03
per cent. of the total weight, the quality of the mantle is
seriously affected. Particularly is this the case if even the
smallest traces of iron come in contact with the fabric; on
this account wooden implements must be used as far as possible
in the washing house, and all iron parts must be carefully
protected so that no water can drip from them on to the material.</p>

<p>The fabric is used in the form of a long cylindrical tube
usually of about twice the diameter required for the base of
the finished mantle. Before the mineral impurities can be
removed, this must be entirely freed from grease. It is therefore
washed thoroughly with a warm solution of sodium carbonate,
which removes all the hydrolysable fats. If paraffin
or other non-hydrolysable grease is present, the alkaline wash
must be followed by a soap wash. The fabric is now cleansed
from alkali and soap by running water, and mineral impurities
are removed by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid
(1-3 per cent.) at a temperature of 50°-60°C.; it is finally
washed free from acid with distilled water. So susceptible
is the mantle to traces of impurity that the use of ordinary
tap water, or even of a distilled water which has become contaminated
to the smallest degree, for this final washing, will
considerably lower its efficiency.</p>

<p>A centrifugal machine removes most of the water, and the
drying is completed by passage over wooden rollers, through a
small chamber, of which the air is kept at 30°-40°C. The
dried fabric is now cut into lengths ready for the next process.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Impregnation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The composition of the ‘Lighting Fluid,’
as the solution of salts used for impregnation is technically
termed, varies slightly according to the nature of the mantle
required, and the conditions of washing. It is of the greatest
importance that the ratio of thoria to ceria should be constant
and definite; the usual proportions are chosen so that the
ratio of the oxides is 99&nbsp;: 1. <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a> shows at a glance to
what a remarkable extent small variations in the percentage<span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span>
of ceria affect the luminosity of the finished product.<a id="FNanchor518"></a><a href="#Footnote518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The
thorium nitrate is made up with distilled water to a solution
of 25-35 per cent. strength, and the calculated quantity of a
standard solution of cerium nitrate is added. It is usual to add
to the mixture a small quantity of another nitrate, which on
ignition will leave an oxide of which the function is to strengthen
the skeleton of ash. Beryllium, zirconium, magnesium, or
aluminium nitrate is usually employed, in quantity calculated
to leave an amount of oxide constituting about 0·5 per cent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span>
of the total oxides; for ramie fabrics, beryllium nitrate is
generally chosen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote518"><a href="#FNanchor518"><span class="label">[518]</span></a>
Numberless theories have been advanced to account for the extraordinarily
high light-emitting power of this particular mixture of thoria and ceria. An
account of these would be beyond the province of the present work; the
reader who desires to pursue the subject should consult the interesting work
of Dr. H. W. Fischer, <i>Der Auerstrumpf</i>, Ahren’s <i>Sammlung</i>, 1906, vol. xi.

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>After having been immersed for two to five minutes in the
solution, the separate lengths are freed from excess of the
lighting fluid by means of a small wringing machine. The
pressure between the rollers must be regulated very exactly,
since on the amount of solution taken up by the fabric will
depend the mass of the oxide skeleton. The weight of oxides
left after ignition should be 0·5-0·6 gm. for a ‘normal’ upright
mantle of 9·5 cm. length, corresponding to 1·0-1·2 gms.
of the nitrates, or, for a 30 per cent. solution, to 3·3-4·0 gms.
of solution. The weight of the fabric before impregnation is
approximately 5 gms. for cotton, 3 gms. for ramie, and 1·5 gms.
for artificial silk. A cotton mantle-fabric, therefore, must
be allowed to retain rather less, a ramie fabric rather more,
than its own weight of solution, whilst an artificial silk fabric
must take up 2-2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> times its own weight of the fluid. The
weight of the oxide ash left from these quantities has been
found by experience to be most suitable; if the mass is greater
than this, the light-emission is diminished without a compensating
gain in strength; if it is less, the light-emission is indeed
greater, but the mantle becomes too fragile.</p>

<p>The impregnated fabric-lengths, after passing through the
wringing machine, are drawn singly on to glass forms which
are arranged on stands, and freed from moisture in a drying
room by hot air, a temperature of about 30°C. being maintained.
Three to four hours are required, under these conditions; if
the drying be too rapid, considerable shrinkage occurs, and
the mantles obtained are then extremely fragile.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The Mantle Head.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The normal upright mantle is supported
from a central rod of compressed magnesia&mdash;fused quartz has
recently been suggested<a id="FNanchor519"></a><a href="#Footnote519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>&mdash;by means of an asbestos thread.
The thread in the older patterns was supported by simply
doubling over the fabric at the end which was to become the
head; more generally, however, a strip of tulle or gauze is
sewn to the head end before the impregnation. In order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
strengthen the head, it is treated before ‘finishing’ with a
hardening or ‘fixing’ fluid, which usually consists of a mixture
of magnesium and aluminium nitrates in aqueous solution;
the following may be cited as a typical mixture: Aluminium
nitrate, 300 parts; magnesium nitrate, 300 parts; chromium
nitrate, 3 parts; borax, 5 parts; distilled water, 1500 parts.
In order to secure that this fluid is applied to the head only,
a little organic colouring matter is generally added, so that
it may be clearly seen. The solution is soaked on to the
head from mechanically held felt pads, which are kept at a
convenient degree of saturation with the fluid by means of an
ingenious compressed-air device. The mantle is then rapidly
dried in a hot-air chamber.</p>

opening of some ten millimetres being left, and the asbestos is
threaded diametrically across this opening&mdash;these diametrical
threads support the mantle on its rod during use. These
operations were formerly done by hand, when mantles of good
quality were required, but machine treatment is gradually
coming into extended use. Several mantles now on the market
are supported at the head by metal rings, made from thin
sheets of iron which have been plated with aluminium. In
petroleum lamps, the mantle is usually supported from both
sides by means of asbestos threads.</p>

<p>In the case of fabrics from which ‘inverted’ mantles are
to be made, fixing is carried out as usual at one end, to a depth
of about 1·5 cm. After drying, a strip of about 0·5 cm. width
is bent over and sewn down, and through this double band
an asbestos thread is drawn, by which the mantle is secured
to a magnesia ring. The lower end is drawn together in the
shape of a hemisphere, by means of threads drawn through the
meshes of the fabric; an opening of 6-8 mm. is sometimes left,
but in the more modern patterns the end is drawn almost completely
together, and after cutting is pressed out on a wooden
shaper by a wooden mallet.</p>

<p>The product is now ready for burning off; if it is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
marked, it is stamped at this stage with a solution of didymium
nitrate and methylene blue; the former being only faintly
coloured, the organic dye is added to give a definite impression.
On ignition, the nitrate is converted into the oxide,
which is deeply coloured, and, of course, permanent.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Burning off and Shaping.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;For the production of mantles
of the best quality, these processes are usually carried out by
skilled operators, each mantle being treated separately. Very
frequently, however, mechanical arrangements are employed.
The great objection to machine treatment of such a product lies
in the fact that it must be identical for every mantle; whereas
it is exceedingly difficult to ensure that the original fabric,
and the processes of washing, impregnating, wringing, and drying
have been absolutely uniform. The operation of shaping
and hardening is a very delicate one, and on the care with
which it is carried out, the quality of the mantle finally depends.
Until quite recently, only the cheaper kinds of mantles were
machine-treated; but as the uniformity of the fabric becomes
more assured, and the earlier operations more exact, employment
of machines at this stage will undoubtedly increase.</p>

<p>The prepared fabric is shaped on a suitable form, and removed
by a holder, which supports it from the asbestos thread;
a flame is then applied to the head. The burning-off proceeds
readily, once started; when the upper half has been incinerated,
the flame is removed. The weight of the unburnt portion
prevents too rapid contraction taking place at first; when
the flame is removed, the glow spreads slowly downwards,
and the shrinking is thus kept as uniform as possible. The
operation must be carried out under a ventilating hood. The
organic material of the fabric is completely oxidised, and the
nitrates are converted into oxides, which retain the exact
shape of the original fibres. The skeleton now undergoes the
process of shaping and hardening, for which a ‘radial’ blowpipe
flame is used. The burnt-off product is placed over this;
the gas is supplied at an initial pressure of only a few inches of
water, which is increased towards the end of the operation.
The process commences at the head, the mantle being slowly
lifted and rotated so that it is shaped and hardened along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
whole length. By this means the oxide skeleton is not only
suitably shaped, but is rendered considerably more elastic
and resistant. For inverted mantles, of course, specially shaped
burners are required. The eyes of the operators must be
protected from the glare by shades of green glass. Recently
the processes of burning-off and hardening have been carried
out by means of the same burner.</p>

<p>Where machines are employed, the prepared fabrics are
burnt off on wire shapers, usually in rows of ten; mechanical
arrangements for continuous ignition and motion and, in the
hardening, for continuous elevation of the ash-skeleton, are
in use, but the finished mantles maintain a uniform good
quality only when the structure of the fabric and the earlier
processes have been absolutely uniform.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Collodinisation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;The burnt-off mantle is now ready for use,
but is far too fragile for transport. A method has therefore
to be found by which the finished product can be protected for a
time without detriment to its use for illumination. Mantles of
artificial silk, particularly those for use in high-pressure lamps,
are sometimes sent out without having undergone the final
processes of burning off and shaping, which, in this case, must
be carried out on the consumer’s burner. ‘Inverted’ mantles
also were formerly sent out after impregnation and drying. In
this condition, of course, the mantles are readily packed and
transported, and there is the additional advantage that the
duty on the unburnt product is very much less than that on the
finished mantle.</p>

<p>One of the earliest of Auer’s patents (<i>vide supra</i>, <a href="#Page271">p. 271</a>)
protected the process of collodinisation, which is now extensively
employed. The oxide skeleton is dipped into a solution
of collodion (the mixed lower nitro-derivatives of cellulose, or
cellulose nitrates) in a mixture of alcohol and ether, to which,
to prevent shrinkage on drying, a little camphor is added.
On account of the inflammability of the mixture, the ethyl
alcohol and ether are occasionally replaced by a mixture of
methyl alcohol and acetone, but with this less volatile mixture,
drying of course is slower. After dipping, the solvents are
removed in a current of air, leaving the mantle coated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>
an exceedingly thin film of collodion, which increases enormously
its power of resisting shock and vibration. This film
is not removed until the mantle is placed on the consumer’s
burner, when on the application of a match it ignites instantly
and burns away, leaving the oxide skeleton in the condition
to which it was brought in the final stage of hardening and
shaping in the factory. The process is now used for almost
all kinds of mantles, having been successfully applied in Germany
in recent years to those made from artificial silk. The addition
of small quantities of various inorganic salts, <i>e.g.</i> nitrates of
zirconium, magnesium, platinum, thorium, etc., to the collodion
solution, has been proposed; these salts make the
collodinised product extremely resistant, but have a very
harmful effect on the oxide ash when the collodion has been
burnt off.</p>

<p>The collodinised mantles are cut to length on a trimming
machine, and are then ready for packing.</p>

<p>With regard to the composition of mantles, numerous
proposals have been made. It is stated that thoria with
0·25 per cent. of uranic oxide, UO₃, gives a light almost equal
to that of the Auer mantle. Zirconia with 0·40 per cent. of
vanadium, in the form of the pentoxide, is said to give a
splendid white light; the vanadium oxide slowly volatilises,
but addition of an equivalent proportion of silica is said to
prevent this. Langhans claims to have obtained a product
equal in light-giving power to the Auer mantle, by using as
impregnating fluid a solution of colloidal silica, obtained by
the addition of nitric acid to a solution of sodium silicate,
to which suitable quantities of rare earth nitrates are added.
Bodies obtained by the use of very similar solutions give<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
skeletons which are coming into extended employment for
gas radiators. The ‘Sunlight’ mantles use a mixture of
thoria (50 per cent.), alumina (40 per cent.), and chromium
sesquioxide (10 per cent.).</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XX</span><br />
ARTIFICIAL SILK&mdash;ITS PRODUCTION AND USE IN
THE MANTLE INDUSTRY</h3>

<p>The history of the artificial silk industry, since its foundation
about the year 1890, illustrates curiously the rapidity with
which isolated facts, of apparently merely academic interest,
are seized upon and adapted to the needs of modern civilisation.
It is during this period, especially, that the bonds between
science and industry, in a dozen different directions, have been
drawn so close that to-day it is in many cases impossible to
differentiate the two. The pure science of to-day is the technology
of to-morrow&mdash;and not always even of to-morrow, but of
to-day. But we have moved even beyond this; the industrial
needs of the day are creating and extending our science at a
rate which shows how relatively poor a stimulus has been the
mere desire for knowledge. Such has been the history of the
artificial silk industry. No sooner had Chardonnet shown that
the preparation of a new fabric was not only possible but
profitable, than a thousand aspects of the problem were taken up.
Patents were taken out on all sides&mdash;the majority, as usual,
valueless, one or two of great importance. Companies were
formed, factories built, machines invented; numberless applications
were proposed, mostly again worthless, whilst patient
research and innumerable experiments have carried one or
two suggestions to a successful place in practice. Among these
has been the adaptation of artificial silk to the manufacture
of mantles, which will be outlined in the present chapter.
Before taking up this question, however, a short account of the
manufacture of the fabric itself must be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Chardonnet Process.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;In the Chardonnet process, an
account of which was published about 1890, continuous fibres
are obtained by forcing through tiny jets a viscous solution of
collodion, or nitrocellulose, as it has been misnamed, in a
mixture of ethyl alcohol and ether. In the original form of the
process, the solution was forced into water, which, by removing
the alcohol and ether, caused an instantaneous coagulation
of the surface, so that a filament was obtained which could be
wound directly on to a spool. More generally, however, the
jets deliver the solution into a chamber through which warm
air is passed; this is equally effective in removing the solvents
and causing surface coagulation, and the filaments are woven
directly into threads of ten to forty strands, according to the
purpose for which the fabric is required, fifteen to twenty being
used for silk from which mantles are to be made. On account
of its inflammability, the thread is denitrated by means of a
solution of ammonium sulphide.</p>

<p>The raw material for the process is cellulose, usually in
the form of cotton. Treatment of this with a suitable mixture
of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids replaces some of
the hydroxyl groups by the ‘nitrate radicle,’ NO₃, a mixture
of various nitrates of cellulose being formed, in which the so-called
tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nitrates predominate.<a id="FNanchor525"></a><a href="#Footnote525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The
product, cellulose nitrate or collodion, very closely resembles
the original cellulose in appearance and structure. It is
washed thoroughly to free it from traces of acid&mdash;which render
it liable to explode spontaneously&mdash;and after drying, dissolved
in the minimum quantity of the mixed solvents;<a id="FNanchor526"></a><a href="#Footnote526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> the solution
is filtered from insoluble impurities through wads of cotton,
pressures of thirty to sixty atmospheres being required. This
filtration purifies and thoroughly mixes the solution, so that
perfect uniformity is obtained in the product. The glass jets<span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span>
through which the solution is now forced, under a pressure
of forty to fifty atmospheres, have a diameter of 0·08 mm.,
but the threads obtained contract on the removal of the solvents,
so that fibres of 0·01-0·02 mm. are formed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote525"><a href="#FNanchor525"><span class="label">[525]</span></a>
The cellulose esters are usually named as if they were derived from a
compound C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀, the formula for cellulose being (C₆H₁₀O₅)<sub><i>n</i></sub>. Thus the
formation of the ‘hexa-nitrate’ would be represented&mdash;</p>

<p class="center highline1">C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀ + 6HNO₃ = C₁₂H₁₄O₄(NO₃)₆ + 6H₂O.</p>

<p id="Footnote526"><a href="#FNanchor526"><span class="label">[526]</span></a>
In the Lehner process, in which collodion is also used, larger quantities of
solvent are employed, so that much more dilute solutions are obtained; these
require low pressures to form the thread, which is then hardened chemically.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Chardonnet probably began his work about 1885. It is
interesting to observe that an Englishman, Swan, had proposed
in 1883 to use a solution of collodion in acetic acid,
fabrics prepared by his process being shown at the London
Exhibition of 1884.<a id="FNanchor527"></a><a href="#Footnote527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

this process in the English patent literature.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p class="clearboth">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The Pauly or Cuprammonium Process.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline unspaced"><a id="FNanchor528"></a><a href="#Footnote528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>&mdash;It has long been
known that a solution of copper hydroxide in ammonia solution&mdash;Schweitzer’s
reagent&mdash;will dissolve cellulose. The use of
this solvent for the production of artificial silk was proposed
about 1900, and the method has become a serious rival of
the older Chardonnet process. The solvent is prepared on a
large scale by passing air through an ammonia solution to
which copper turnings have been added. After addition
of the cellulose, and filtration, the solution is forced through
tiny jets into a bath of dilute acid, which removes the copper
and precipitates the cellulose again.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote528"><a href="#FNanchor528"><span class="label">[528]</span></a>
A full account of this and of the other processes employed in the manufacture
of artificial silk will be found in the work of Piest, <i>Die Zellulose</i>, Stuttgart,
1910.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The solution of cellulose by Schweitzer’s reagent is undoubtedly
a chemical action. Cellulose is to be regarded as
a polyhydric alcohol, with one or several atoms of hydrogen
of the hydroxyl groups replaceable by metals. According
to Piest (<i>loc. cit.</i>) a ‘Cupramine base’ is formed by the replacement
of this hydrogen by copper and the amino-group, NH₂.
The action of sodium hydroxide on cellulose, however, is
generally regarded rather as an additive reaction, the product,
‘alkali cellulose,’ being usually written C₆H₁₀O₅,NaOH. A
careful chemical investigation alone can reveal the actual
nature of the compound formed; such an investigation, apart
from its scientific interest, might yield results of considerable
technical importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The Viscose Process.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Shortly after the introduction of
the Chardonnet process, patents were taken out which protected
a very cheap and simple method of dissolving cellulose,<a id="FNanchor529"></a><a href="#Footnote529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
which had been discovered by two well-known English authorities.
Cross and Bevan. They found that mercerisation,
<i>i.e.</i> the action of the sodium hydroxide on cellulose, produces
a swollen, transparent mass, which very readily takes up
carbon disulphide. When exposed to the action of this liquid
for three or four hours, at ordinary temperatures, the
mass swells further, gelatinising and becoming soluble in
water. On treatment with water, a yellowish, extremely slimy
solution is obtained, from which cellulose is precipitated on
prolonged standing, by heating, or by oxidation. The substance
is apparently a cellulose xanthate, and may be written
NaS·CS·O·C₆H₉O₄,NaOH.<a id="FNanchor530"></a><a href="#Footnote530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> On account of the extremely viscous
nature of the aqueous solution, Cross and Bevan gave it the
name Viscoid.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>During the last few years this method of dissolving cellulose
has been employed in the manufacture of artificial silk,
under the name ‘Viscose Process.’ The product obtained
is very suitable for the manufacture of incandescent mantles,
and is considerably cheaper than either the Chardonnet or
Pauly silk.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The Acetate Process.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Quite recently numerous experiments
have been carried out with the object of finding methods for
employing the cellulose esters of organic acids in the preparation
of fabrics. The acetate, which is generally used, gives solutions
from which fibres can be obtained which are comparable to
natural silk in strength, and which have the further advantage
of being non-inflammable, and far less readily affected by
water than artificial fabrics obtained by the above methods.
It is prepared by treating cellulose with dilute acid, by which
the so-called ‘hydrocellulose’ is obtained; this is treated
with a mixture of glacial acetic acid and acetyl chloride, and
the whole, after addition of a little concentrated sulphuric<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
acid, warmed to 65°-70°C. As early as 1894, Cross and Bevan<a id="FNanchor531"></a><a href="#Footnote531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
had patented a process for this preparation by the action of
acetyl chloride in the cold on an intimate mixture of cellulose
and zinc chloride.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote531"><a href="#FNanchor531"><span class="label">[531]</span></a> <i>E.</i> 9676, 1894.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>From the solution obtained, the acetates are precipitated
by water, washed and dried. The mixture of esters dissolves
in chloroform, nitromethane, acetic acid, phenol, pyridine,
etc., and is re-precipitated by addition of alcohol, benzene, or
ligroin (petroleum ether). On account of its non-inflammable
character, cellulose acetate, as the product is called, is being
used instead of the nitrate in the manufacture of celluloid;
it is also used for non-inflammable cinematograph films. Fibres
can be obtained by forcing the solutions through jets, and removing
the solvent, as in the above processes; these are spun
into threads which are coming into increasing use, on account
of their extremely low conducting power, for the insulation of
very fine electric leads. The product is at present too expensive,
however, for use in the textile industries, or for the manufacture
of mantles.</p>

<p>A solvent which had at one time some technical importance
is zinc chloride.<a id="FNanchor532"></a><a href="#Footnote532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The concentrated aqueous solution of the
salt will take up cellulose in considerable quantity; and the
solution has been used in the preparation of carbon filaments
for glow lamps.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The fabrics prepared by the processes which have been
mentioned above are of great technical value. In lustre they
far surpass natural silk, and they take dyes very well, but
owing to the ease with which they tear, they cannot be woven
alone for textiles, but are always used in ‘mixed’ materials.
The acetate silk, which approaches the natural fibre in strength,
is not much less expensive. Whilst the price of natural silk
is roughly 35 francs per kilo. (approx. 13<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per lb.), the costs
of production of the artificial fabrics are&mdash;Chardonnet 15 frs.,
Pauly 12 frs., Viscose 7 frs. per kilo. (respectively 5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per lb.). Artificial silk, however, has uses distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
from the natural fibre, and is at present a competitor with it
in one or two small fields only. Thus the production of natural
silk is ten times that of artificial silk (50,000,000 kilos. per
annum to 5,000,000 kilos.) in spite of the difference in price.</p>

<p>Artificial silk is very susceptible to the action of water,
which weakens it very considerably. Its resistance is said to
be greatly increased by the action of formaldehyde; the fabric
is plunged into a bath containing an aqueous solution of the
aldehyde, to which a little lactic acid has been added. The
chemistry of the change is discussed at length by Beltzer (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>The threads of artificial silk far surpass in lightness those
spun from vegetable fibres. A thread of twenty strands
weighing one pound avoirdupois would be more than twenty
miles long. At the same time the filaments have not the
irregular tubular structure of vegetable fibres, but are solid
cylinders. The fact that the filaments are continuous, so that
there is relatively little torsion in threads spun from them,
gives artificial silk its great advantage over the natural vegetable
fibres for the manufacture of mantles. For this purpose
the Pauly or Cuprammonium silk is most suitable, though Viscose
silk is almost as good; the fibre obtained by the Chardonnet
process is not quite so useful in this direction.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>The Manufacture of Mantles from Artificial Silk.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Whilst
the fabrics made by the various processes outlined above are
more expensive than the cotton and ramie formerly exclusively
used in the mantle industry, they have the advantage, in
addition to the fact that they produce better and more lasting
mantles, that they do not need the laborious and troublesome
process of washing which is so essential in the case of the
vegetable fibres. From the nature of the methods used in its
manufacture, artificial silk can contain no mineral residue;
hence the fabric is immediately ready for impregnation.</p>

<p id="Ref69">As early as the year 1892 Schlumberger and Sinibaldi
proposed the use of Chardonnet silk for the manufacture of
mantles; but their patent, a Belgian one,<a id="FNanchor533"></a><a href="#Footnote533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
attracted little<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
attention, although they stated clearly that the denitrated silk
will readily take up the lighting fluid. Ignorance of this fact
deferred the successful application of this fibre for ten years.
In 1894 De Mare suggested the preparation of mantles by addition
of the necessary salts to the collodion solution before squirting;
in the following year Knöfler used the same process,
recommending in addition the use of ammonium sulphide to
denitrate the impregnated threads. These two attempts, which
were found to be unworkable, owing to the difficulty of obtaining
a homogeneous product before squirting, were merely efforts
to compete against the Auer monopoly, resting on Welsbach’s
patents, which covered impregnation of any natural fibre.
In Knöfler’s process,<a id="FNanchor534"></a><a href="#Footnote534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> the salts were dissolved in alcohol and
added to the collodion solution, which was then forced through
jets into water, to which ammonia was added to prevent removal
of the nitrates in solution; the threads were then denitrated
with ammonium sulphide. The ammonia treatment of course
converts the nitrates into the insoluble hydroxides, a departure
which was followed in most of the numerous patents inspired
by Knöfler’s process.</p>

<p>The first indications of the method which ultimately led
to success are to be found in a patent taken out by Plaisetty,
in 1901.<a id="FNanchor535"></a><a href="#Footnote535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The specification protects the addition of thorium
and cerium hydroxides to the cuprammonium solution of
cellulose, but apparently without any inkling of the results
that were to follow, and more or less incidentally, he includes
in this patent the impregnation of the finished fabric and the
subsequent treatment with ammonia. In the following year
he applied for a German patent,<a id="FNanchor536"></a><a href="#Footnote536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> which was granted in
May, 1903, in which he definitely protects the impregnation
of the finished fabric, and the ammonia treatment, the fabric
being then washed and dried, and burnt off as usual.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Impregnation.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Since the filaments from which artificial
silk is obtained are solid and rod-like in form, as opposed to
the tubular structure of cotton and ramie filaments, it is rather
surprising that the fabric should take up the lighting fluid<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
in the necessary quantity (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page295">p. 295</a>). It is found that a
50 per cent. solution of nitrates gives the best results, the impregnation
requiring half an hour; a warm bath is usually
employed. It is usual to add to the bath a quantity of thorium
hydroxide, since the thorium nitrate of commerce generally
contains nitric acid, which has a bad effect on the fabric.<a id="FNanchor537"></a><a href="#Footnote537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
The excess of solution is removed by means of a glass or porcelain
centrifuge, not, as with cotton or ramie mantles, by use of a
wringer; drying must be carried out very slowly. The fabric is
not cut into lengths before impregnation, as in the case of cotton
or ramie, but is immersed in the lighting fluid in long strips.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>‘Fixing.’</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;If the dried fabric, impregnated with the
necessary salts, be finished and burnt off in the usual way,
the oxide skeleton is extremely fragile, and soon falls to powder.
The reason for this lies probably in the explosive decomposition
of the nitrates, the weight of organic matter relative to the
salts being very much less than in the case of ramie or cotton
fabrics (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page295">p. 295</a>). The additional ammonia bath advocated
by Knöfler (<i>vide <a href="#Ref69">supra</a></i>) was therefore adopted by Plaisetty,
and the nitrates in the dried impregnated fabric are converted
into hydroxides by this treatment. For this process,
to which the name ‘Fixing’ has been given by Böhm, numberless
alternative proposals have been made. Plaisetty’s ammonia
fixing gives a mantle which, after burning off, is exceedingly
elastic and strong, but it is nevertheless open to serious objections.
Thus the nitrates may be to some extent dissolved
out by the fixing bath before precipitation of the hydroxides
has occurred; to remedy this, the impregnated fabric must
be very thoroughly dried before fixing, and in this case, apart
from the trouble involved, the acid of the commercial nitrates
will attack the fabric unless addition of thorium hydroxide
has been made to the impregnating fluid. Again, the conversion
into oxides is not complete, the outer layer first formed
preventing free diffusion of the alkaline fluid. Finally, since
ammonium nitrate is formed in the reaction, a very thorough
washing is necessary to remove this salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span></p>

<p>It would be impossible to mention all of the numberless
proposals which have been put forward for fixing; nor are
the great majority worthy of mention.<a id="FNanchor538"></a><a href="#Footnote538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> One of the most important
was that of Albrecht,<a id="FNanchor539"></a><a href="#Footnote539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> by which hydrogen peroxide
is substituted for ammonia. This reagent, as is well known,
precipitates from solutions of thorium salts ‘peroxide’
compounds (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page255">p. 255</a>); from the fabric impregnated with
the nitrate, free nitric acid is liberated in the reaction. Since
the peroxide is soluble in nitric acid, two baths are used, the
fabric being allowed to remain for a short time only in the
first, which becomes strongly acid, and being then transferred to
the second, in which the precipitation is completed. The burning
off of the product so treated proceeds quite quietly, and leaves
a very hard and elastic skeleton. The method, however, has
the grave disadvantage that cerium salts are not precipitated
under these conditions, but escape into the solution. To
remedy this, arbitrary additions of cerium nitrate are made
to the fixing bath, but the percentage of cerium, and therefore
the lighting power (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page293">p. 293</a>) of mantles fixed by this method
is liable to fluctuate. A modification has been introduced<a id="FNanchor540"></a><a href="#Footnote540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
in which various salts are added to the hydrogen peroxide
fixing baths to prevent the withdrawal of the cerium salt;
these are chiefly acetates of the alkali metals and allied compounds.
The fabric requires washing after this treatment.</p>

<p>A rather similar proposal<a id="FNanchor541"></a><a href="#Footnote541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> substitutes for ammonia an
alkaline solution of hydrogen peroxide, obtained by dissolving
sodium peroxide in water. After saturation for a minute or so,
the fabric is wrung out and dried, there being no necessity,
according to the patent, for any subsequent washing. The
same company in an earlier patent<a id="FNanchor542"></a><a href="#Footnote542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> suggest a fixing bath
of ‘an alkali or amine with an acid which can form insoluble
basic double salts with the earth metals,’ the said salt to be
precipitated on the fibre, whilst an alkali or amine nitrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
goes into solution; acetic and benzoic acids and phenol are
mentioned. Apparently this process did not give satisfactory
results. The same may be said of the hypochlorite
method of Visseaux.<a id="FNanchor543"></a><a href="#Footnote543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Equally interesting, and doubtless

is to be treated with an alcoholic solution of hydrofluoric
acid, which will give a viscous insoluble mixture of thorium

remove any impurities. Another patent<a id="FNanchor547"></a><a href="#Footnote547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> proposes the use
of hydrazine and similar bases, cerium nitrate being added

<p>More recently, the use of organic salts of thorium and cerium
for impregnation has been proposed by Dr. F. W. Wirth;<a id="FNanchor550"></a><a href="#Footnote550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
in fixing the impregnated fabric with hydrogen peroxide, the
cerium is not removed in solution, since the weak organic acid
formed will not dissolve cerium peroxide. The same author
has also suggested<a id="FNanchor551"></a><a href="#Footnote551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
the addition to the fixing bath of substances
which absorb oxygen from the air&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> sodium hydrogen
sulphite, resorcinol, tannin&mdash;to prevent removal of cerium.
He has also advocated impregnation with amorphous
salts,<a id="FNanchor552"></a><a href="#Footnote552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span>
which will obviate the necessity for any subsequent fixing
treatment, the hypophosphites and double compounds with
ammonium oxalate being specified. Attempts have been made
to achieve the same end by other methods. Thus Silbermann<a id="FNanchor553"></a><a href="#Footnote553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
has proposed a preliminary treatment with alkalies (mercerisation);
the fabric is treated with concentrated sodium
hydroxide solution in absence of air for half an hour, pressed
through rollers, and plunged into the impregnating solution.
Two years previously a patent was taken out by Drossbach<a id="FNanchor554"></a><a href="#Footnote554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
to protect the use of colloidal solutions of the hydroxides.
To a boiling suspension of well-washed, freshly-precipitated
thorium hydroxide, a solution of a small quantity of the nitrate
is gradually added; after half an hour a colloidal solution is
obtained, which, after the addition of the required quantity
of cerium nitrate, and dilution to a suitable extent, is employed
directly for impregnation. The patent states that this solution
is more readily absorbed than the ordinary nitrate solution,
but the statement has been questioned.</p>

<p>Artificial silk itself is of a colloidal nature, the solidification
of the filaments of cellulose during the manufacture being
rather in the nature of a coagulation than of a precipitation; it
is to this fact that the fibres owe their solid, rod-like structure,
and it is probably this circumstance also which determines
the very intimate absorption of the hydroxides or peroxides
produced by fixing. It is well known that colloidal substances
under some circumstances possess the property of clinging
tenaciously to foreign bodies, exhibiting the so-called phenomenon
of adsorption. The strength and elasticity of the oxide
skeleton, obtained when the fixed and dried fabric is subjected
to the operation of burning off, are presumably to be referred
to such a relation between the cellulose of the fibres and the
insoluble thorium and cerium compounds, precipitated by one
of the methods of fixing described.</p>

After the ordinary strengthening process for the head (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page296">p. 296</a>)
the process of manufacture was, until recently, finished, the
goods being sent out in the unburnt condition, on account of
the difficulties of collodinisation. These have now been overcome,
so that the mantles are burnt off and collodinised as
usual. Burning off and shaping are now frequently effected
in one operation by machine; the nature of the methods by
which the fibre is made produces a uniform fabric, and if the
earlier processes are carefully carried out, a uniform product
is obtained, which is therefore suitable for machine treatment.</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XXI</span><br />
OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL USES OF THE CERIUM
AND YTTRIUM ELEMENTS, ZIRCONIUM
AND THORIUM</h3>

<p>The technical uses of the members of this group of the elements
we are considering, apart from the employment in the manufacture
of incandescent mantles, are at present very restricted.
Innumerable proposals for the employment of the compounds
of cerium and the allied metals, which are obtained in such large
quantities as by-products in the thorium industry, have been
put forward, but the actual extent to which they are utilised
is so small that only an insignificant fraction of the available
quantities is annually required. In the metallic form, a limited
application is found for various alloys, <i>e.g.</i> the so-called
pyrophoric alloys, misch metal, and the magnesium and aluminium
alloys. Various compounds of the elements, as well as
some alloys, have been suggested for use in arc-lamp electrodes,
and the use of the metals themselves, as well as of various
salts, for the manufacture of flashlight powders, is protected
by several patents. Investigations have been made to determine
the value of the oxides and sulphates as catalysts in the
contact process for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, and one
patent states that the yield obtained is equal to that given
by platinised asbestos. Cerium salts have been proposed for
tanning, and in the preparation of enamels; cerium sodium
sulphate is used in the catalytic oxidation of aniline to aniline
black. The oxalate has a very slight use in medicine. The
oxidising power of ceric salts is of some use in photography;
ceric sulphate in acid solution is also said to be an efficient
oxidising agent for aromatic hydrocarbons. On account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span>
deep colour of the higher oxide of praseodymium, didymium
salts find a limited application for marking textiles.</p>

<p>Compounds of the yttrium group have at present no technical
importance. They were formerly used to some extent
for the manufacture of filaments for Nernst lamps, but with
the introduction of metal filament lamps in electric lighting,
the demand for Nernst lamps and consequently for the
yttria oxides, has to a very great extent died away.</p>

<p>Zirconium and its compounds, on the other hand, promise
to become of some technical importance. The metal received
considerable attention in the earlier stages of experimental
work on metallic filaments for electric lighting, but it has
been shown that its melting-point is not sufficiently high to
allow of extended use in this direction. The carbide has been
proposed for the same purpose, but is even less suitable; this
compound, however, on account of its great hardness, is likely
to find employment as an abrasive, and in glass-cutting. The
oxide, which occurs in nature in an impure form as the mineral
<a href="#Ref70">Baddeleyite</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), is employed in the manufacture of ‘Siloxide’
glass and of enamels, as a pigment and polishing agent, and
in various forms of lamps, <i>e.g.</i> the Nernst and Bleriot lamps,
the Drummond light, etc. Far more important, however, is
its use for fire-resistant crucibles, furnace linings and supports,
etc., for which its refractory nature renders it particularly
suitable. On account of its high specific gravity and non-poisonous
character, it has been proposed for use in the Röntgen
ray examination of the human body. Quite recently, metallic
zirconium has been employed in metallurgy; addition
of small quantities, in the form of suitable alloys, is said to
secure sound castings, with increased strength and resistance
to acids.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Cerium Group</span></h4>

<h5 class="inline"><b>Pyrophoric Alloys.</b></h5>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;It has long been known that the
metals of the cerium group possess the property, when scratched
or struck, of throwing off glowing particles; this power of
emitting sparks is not lost when the metals are alloyed, so
long as the percentage of foreign metal is not allowed to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
too high. In a patent<a id="FNanchor555"></a><a href="#Footnote555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> protecting the use of various ‘pyrophoric
alloys,’ as these spark-giving alloys are called, Auer
states that the pure metals do not show this property, which only
appears when foreign metals are present; he accordingly
patents alloys of the cerium metals with iron, specifying
particularly the alloy with 30 per cent. of the latter element.
Auer’s statement has been contradicted,<a id="FNanchor556"></a><a href="#Footnote556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> and it seems to be
generally accepted that misch-metal<a id="FNanchor557"></a><a href="#Footnote557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> of ordinary technical
purity has the property of sparking when scratched. This
alloy of the cerium metals, however, is far too soft to be useful
for the purpose, and the addition of some foreign element is
required to obtain the strength, hardness, and brittleness
necessary in the various forms of ‘lighters.’ Besides the addition
of iron, the use of tin, lead, zinc, cadmium, silicon, etc., has
been patented.<a id="FNanchor558"></a><a href="#Footnote558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

in all of these the sparks produced by scratching the pyrophoric
alloy with hardened steel, by means of some simple
mechanical device, is caused to ignite a fragment of tinder, or
a wick supplied with a suitable liquid, <i>e.g.</i> methyl alcohol,
benzene, or petrol. In the numberless forms of cigarette-lighters
at present before a somewhat indifferent public, the
friction is obtained by means of a toothed wheel, actuated by
a spring which is released when the device is opened. Many
forms of gas lighter are also on the market, but the demand
for them is very small. Many attempts have been made to
adapt the device to the ignition of the Davy miners’ lamp,
but none have been successful, since it is impossible to prevent
the sparks flying through the gauze. Much work has also been
spent in efforts to utilise the pyrophoric alloys for the automatic
ignition of incandescent gas-lamps, but these have been equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page316">[316]</span>
unsuccessful, so that it may be said that important technical

<p>Auer prepared his alloys by addition of iron, or other

in the electrolytic apparatus employed for the production of
the latter. They can, however, be prepared by fusing together
the required quantities of foreign metal and misch-metal, the
latter being obtained by processes other than those of electrolysis
usually employed. The rare metals were obtained by the
earlier chemists in a very impure state by reduction of the
halogen or double halogen compounds with sodium or potassium.
More recently<a id="FNanchor560"></a><a href="#Footnote560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>

method,<a id="FNanchor561"></a><a href="#Footnote561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> which has been employed in the preparation of metallic

magnesium in an atmosphere of hydrogen or nitrogen;
by this means, hydrides or nitrides are obtained, which on
heating decompose into the gas and the metal.</p>

<p>The ease with which misch-metal and its alloys with iron
and other elements throw off glowing particles when struck is
due to the low ignition temperature of cerium, and the energy
with which it combines with oxygen. When such alloys are
scratched, small fragments are struck off, which are raised to
the ignition temperature by the heat of friction. It is generally
accepted, however, that this explanation is by no means a
complete one, and the existence of a pyrophoric suboxide
was suggested.<a id="FNanchor562"></a><a href="#Footnote562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The theory was advanced that the pyrophoric
properties of the alloys were due primarily to the formation
on the surface of a film of this sub-oxide, and the partial oxidation
of cerium alloys, protected by patent (<i>loc. cit.</i>), was said
to cause a marked increase in the ease with which sparks could
be obtained. In this connection, an experiment of Hirsch,
who has thoroughly investigated the properties of metallic
cerium,<a id="FNanchor563"></a><a href="#Footnote563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
is of interest. He found that when the element<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
is warmed in a sealed glass bottle, a black powder forms on
the surface, which, when the bottle is opened, ignites spontaneously.
It is probable that this black sub-oxide plays an
important part in the production of sparks from the ordinary
pyrophoric alloys.</p>

the rare earth metal acting as a purifying agent,<a id="FNanchor567"></a><a href="#Footnote567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> and greatly
improving the properties of the aluminium. The cerium may
be introduced as fluoride, either to the electrolytic bath in
which the aluminium is being prepared, or to the latter metal,
after preparation, in the fused state. The most favourable
effect is said to be produced by 0·2 per cent. of cerium.</p>

<p class="hinline unspaced"><a id="FNanchor568"></a><a href="#Footnote568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>&mdash;One of the
earliest investigations in which cerium compounds were
examined with a view to technical employment, was that of
Kruis,<a id="FNanchor569"></a><a href="#Footnote569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> who made experiments on the comparative value of
the salts of different metals as catalysts in the manufacture
of aniline black. He showed that a solution of aniline with
an oxidising agent (potassium chlorate or chromate) develops
no colouration unless a salt of a heavy metal is present. In
the case of the fabric impregnated with the solution, the only
metals of which compounds were found suitable for producing
a colour were copper, which was then generally used for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
purpose, and cerium, iron, and manganese. Of these, cerium,
used in the form of the double sulphate, was found to be by far
the most suitable, and moreover to have the advantage that only
small quantities are required; the price was at that time too
high to allow of its use, but it has since been employed.<a id="FNanchor570"></a><a href="#Footnote570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Cerium

thin metallic filament, to raise the conductor to incandescence.
Numerous efforts were made to adapt platinum to this purpose,
but its melting-point was finally admitted to be too low; at
length it was found possible to produce carbon filaments, and
the well-known carbon lamps came into use. Numerous
attempts were made to effect improvements;<a id="FNanchor586"></a><a href="#Footnote586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> one plan was to

advance, however, was effected by Nernst, who took
up the study of ‘conductors of the second order,’ and within
a few months succeeded in adapting these to the purposes
of illumination (1897-1898). The Nernst lamps gave a very
intense white light with considerably less consumption of
electricity than the carbon filament lamps; they enjoyed a
very considerable vogue for some years, but have been almost
entirely displaced by the cheaper metal filament lamps, which

<p>In his first patent,<a id="FNanchor589"></a><a href="#Footnote589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
Nernst proposed the use of a rod of magnesia
or zirconia as filament; these oxides, which belong to his
class of conductors of the second order, are non-conductors at<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
ordinary temperatures, but their resistance decreases as the
temperature rises, so that at high temperatures they will
conduct electricity at the ordinary voltage. The preliminary
heating was at first effected by means of a Bunsen burner, but
a later patent<a id="FNanchor590"></a><a href="#Footnote590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> of the same year protects a method of heating
by means of a platinum spiral in an auxiliary circuit, which is
automatically cut out when the current in the main circuit,
bearing the filament, attains its required strength. In the
following year<a id="FNanchor591"></a><a href="#Footnote591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> it was found that filaments composed of mixtures
of oxides were far more suitable than the earlier magnesia
or zirconia rods; yttria, thoria, and zirconia were the chief
oxides used, small quantities of ceria being occasionally introduced.
With these filaments, the increase of conductivity
with temperature is far more rapid than with the pure oxides;
the preliminary heating required, therefore, is less and the light
obtained more intense. The filaments used were in the form
of rods or spirals obtained by compressing the powdered oxides.</p>

<p>The Nernst filaments differ markedly from those of the
ordinary electric glow lamp in that they are not conductors
in the ordinary sense (or of the first order, as Nernst puts it)
but electrolytes, the passage of the current being actually
attended by an electro-chemical change in the filament.<a id="FNanchor592"></a><a href="#Footnote592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
The oxide is ionised; the ions of the metals travel to the cathode
or negative pole, where the liberated atoms of metal instantly
recombine with the oxygen of the air, whilst oxygen ions travel
to the anode, from which the gas is liberated. There is thus
a gradual redistribution, resulting in accumulation of oxide
at the cathode with a corresponding loss at the anode, which
is balanced, after some time, by diffusion, so that equilibrium
is attained. In consequence of this redistribution the filament
glows more brightly at the anode, where it is thinnest, than
at the cathode.</p>

<p>One of the general methods for the preparation of the
metallic filaments may be illustrated by a patent taken out in
1902 by Sander,<a id="FNanchor594"></a><a href="#Footnote594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> for the preparation of filaments of zirconium,
with or without addition of zirconium carbide. The metal, or
a compound which on heating will yield the metal and a volatile
substance which can be removed, is prepared in a finely divided
condition, and made into a paste with some organic binding
material; the paste is then forced through a tiny aperture,
and the resulting thread is shaped and heated to a high temperature
<i>in vacuo</i> or in an inert atmosphere. If an organic
substance be used to form a paste with metallic zirconium,
the final process of heating results in the formation of the
carbide; the same compound is also obtained by another
process protected by Sander (<i>loc. cit.</i>) in which the hydride of
zirconium, prepared by the reduction of the oxide by means
of powdered magnesium in an atmosphere of hydrogen, is
mixed with a cellulose solution, and the liquid treated as in the
manufacture of artificial silk, the threads obtained being then
heated to remove all organic matter as far as possible.</p>

<p>The carbide is also probably obtained by the process of
the British Thomson-Houston Company, in which advantage
is taken of the fact that zirconium oxalate is a pasty gelatinous
substance, which can be forced through a die to form a thread
without addition of any agglutinating agent. The oxalate,
precipitated by addition of ammonium oxalate to a solution of
a zirconium salt, is mixed with finely divided carbon, and the
threads obtained from the pasty mass heated to a very high
temperature in a furnace.<a id="FNanchor595"></a><a href="#Footnote595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Zirconium oxalate is also proposed

<p>By far the most important property of the oxide, from the
technical point of view, is the ease with which it resists high
temperatures. The natural oxide can be freed, to a very large
extent, from the iron oxide which it encloses, by the prolonged
action of hydrochloric acid; experiments were carried
out on the material so obtained by Simonis,<a id="FNanchor604"></a><a href="#Footnote604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> who showed
that by prolonged heating at a high temperature, the remaining
impurities, chiefly ferric oxide and silica, could be
volatilised, leaving the zirconia unchanged. Riecke<a id="FNanchor605"></a><a href="#Footnote605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> showed
that whilst the oxide is very suitable for the manufacture
of highly resistant crucibles, its use is restricted by the fact
that it is easily reduced by carbon at high temperatures,
forming the carbide.</p>

<h3><span class="topline">CHAPTER XXII</span><br />
THE INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF TITANIUM AND
ITS COMPOUNDS</h3>

<p>Though probably at least as plentiful in nature as most of
the common metals, titanium has always, until quite recently,
been regarded as one of the rare elements. Of its chemistry,
very little indeed was known, and it is improbable, even now,
that the pure element has been isolated. It had no technical
value; indeed, its commonest ore, ilmenite or titaniferous
iron ore, was sedulously avoided by manufacturers, who considered
that even very small percentages of the element rendered
an iron ore valueless because unsuitable for working in blast
furnaces. Towards the end of the last century, one or two
metallurgists had demonstrated that ilmenite, under the proper
working conditions, would yield a pig iron of very good quality
when smelted in the blast furnace, but it was left for the long
and arduous researches of Kossi to show that the element is
possessed of properties which render it very valuable for metallurgical
purposes. Since the successful culmination of his work
in the first few years of the present century, titanium has
attained considerable importance in the treatment of special
steels for rails, car wheels, crushing machinery, etc. At present,
titaniferous iron ores are being worked on a large scale, and
many titanium compounds are coming into use for technical
purposes.</p>

<p id="Ref71">The titanium minerals of commercial importance are rutile
and ilmenite (<i>vide</i> Part I. <a href="#Page57">pp. 57</a> and <a href="#Page77">77</a>). The former, the pure
titanium dioxide, is of fairly wide distribution, but ilmenite
occurs in far greater quantities, forming deposits of enormous
dimensions, especially in America, as, <i>e.g.</i> in New York Co.
and Quebec. Owing to its high melting-point and relatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
low specific gravity, metallic titanium can only be incorporated
with molten steels with the greatest difficulty, and for this
reason alloys of titanium and iron, known technically as ferro-titanium,
are usually employed for the treatment of steels.
For the preparation of ferro-titanium, ilmenite of good quality
is as suitable as rutile, and, of course, far cheaper; hence the
latter is only employed for the preparation of titanium salts
for use in colouring and mordanting, and for titanium compounds
for arc-lamp electrodes, etc.</p>

<p>Various processes are employed for the manufacture of
ferro-titanium from ilmenite. In cases in which a considerable
percentage of carbon is not undesirable, for instance, where
the alloy is required for the treatment of cast iron or of high-carbon
steel, the mineral is reduced directly with carbon in
an electric furnace; the ferro-titanium so obtained usually
contains from six to eight per cent. of carbon. For pure iron-titanium
alloys, the process worked out by Rossi<a id="FNanchor609"></a><a href="#Footnote609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> is used
in America almost entirely. Ilmenite is charged into a bath
of molten aluminium, heated electrically; the mineral is at
once attacked, with formation of iron, in which the titanium
dissolves as reduction proceeds. This process may also be
used for reduction of rutile, if scrap iron is added to the aluminium
bath, to allow of the formation of the required alloy.
In Germany, the Goldschmidt or ‘thermite’ reaction is largely
employed; powdered ilmenite is intimately mixed with the
calculated quantity of aluminium powder, reduction being
started as usual by means of a fuse of magnesium ribbon
imbedded in a small quantity of barium peroxide.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Quite recently, the question of the separation of titanium
compounds from ilmenite used for the manufacture of pig
iron has attracted considerable attention. It has been already
mentioned (<i>vide supra</i>) that titaniferous iron ores have been
shown to be perfectly amenable to blast-furnace treatment,
the old and deeply rooted idea that titanium-bearing slags are
stiff and troublesome being entirely contrary to facts, when
suitable conditions are observed;<a id="FNanchor610"></a><a href="#Footnote610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
moreover, it is shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
that the pig iron obtained is of unusually good quality. Rossi
has suggested<a id="FNanchor611"></a><a href="#Footnote611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> that if sufficient carbon be added to reduce all
the silica and oxides of iron, with enough lime to slag off the
titanium dioxide as calcium titanate, the latter can be used as
a source of titanium compounds or alloys, whilst a ferro-silicon
will be obtained as pig metal; the temperature must be carefully
adjusted to ensure reduction of the silica without loss
of titanium dioxide. Another patent<a id="FNanchor612"></a><a href="#Footnote612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> proposes the reduction
of the ore in an electric furnace, and the treatment of the
crude ferro-titanium in a converter with a blast of air or nitrogen;
the titanium nitride formed is then driven out of the metal
by a blast of superheated steam&mdash;any ammonia or cyanogen
formed being collected&mdash;and removed, the iron remaining
being ‘Bessemerised’ directly in the same converter; the
titanium nitride can be used as a manure, or for the manufacture
of ammonia or nitric acid (<i>vide infra</i>). The removal
of iron as the volatile carbonyl has also been suggested,<a id="FNanchor613"></a><a href="#Footnote613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> the
titanium being subsequently transformed into the nitride.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Employment of the Element in Metallurgy.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;It has been
already mentioned that titanium itself is quite unsuitable for
direct incorporation with steel. Besides the relatively low
specific gravity (5·2), which would render mixing very difficult,
the very high melting-point (given by Weiss and Kayser<a id="FNanchor614"></a><a href="#Footnote614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
as 2350°) would prevent uniform dissemination. The element
is therefore generally used in the form of a ferro-titanium of
low titanium content, 10-15 per cent. being the proportion
usually employed. The addition should be made at the end
of the Bessemer process, and after the addition of the required
quantities of manganese and silicon alloys; the calculated
quantity of ferro-titanium is added as the steel runs from the
converter into the ladle. A suitable proportion is said to be
one-half per cent. of alloy, so that the actual proportion of
titanium to steel is somewhere about 1·5-1·8 lb. per ton.
Six or eight minutes should be allowed after the addition, for
the titaniferous slag to come to the surface.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span></p>

<p>Although low percentage ferro-titanium is usually employed,
it has been stated that high-percentage alloys, and even the
element itself, are immediately taken up by steel if aluminium
be added at the same time. Thus Venator<a id="FNanchor615"></a><a href="#Footnote615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> states that if
titanium and aluminium be added together to the bath, both
elements are immediately taken up, the reaction being very
rapid and complete; the effects produced by the titanium
are in no way influenced by the presence of the aluminium.
Goldschmidt<a id="FNanchor616"></a><a href="#Footnote616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> proposes the use of ferro-titanium containing
24-25 per cent. of the element, with 3 per cent. of aluminium;
this dissolves very readily, is very effective, and moreover,
can be very easily prepared by the alumino-thermic reaction.</p>

<p>In some cases, where it is desired to treat a steel both with
silicon and with titanium, ferro-alloys containing both of these
elements may be employed. By reduction of ilmenite or
rutile with carbon in an electric furnace, in presence of silica,
Becket<a id="FNanchor617"></a><a href="#Footnote617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> obtains alloys of high titanium and silicon content,
which are said to dissolve very easily in molten steels and to
produce improved effects. The Titanium Alloy Manufacturing
Company have also patented<a id="FNanchor618"></a><a href="#Footnote618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> the preparation of titanium-silicon
alloys, with or without addition of iron or copper, by
the reduction of a mixture of rutile and quartz.</p>

<p>Recently the use of ferro-titanium in the manufacture
of pig iron has attracted attention. For this purpose, alloys
of very low titanium-content (0·1-1·0 per cent.) are employed.
Addition of very small amounts of such alloys to the molten
metal before casting is said to have a marked cleansing effect,<a id="FNanchor619"></a><a href="#Footnote619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
resulting in much better and stronger castings.</p>

<p>Whilst it is very generally agreed that the addition of
titanium results in the production of much stronger and more
durable products, the question of the precise effect obtained
is by no means definitely settled. The experimental work,
whilst pointing on the whole to the superiority of titanium-treated
steel, is by no means conclusive; in some cases, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span>
it is conflicting. Thus the micro-photographs obtained by
von Maltitz<a id="FNanchor620"></a><a href="#Footnote620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
and Venator<a id="FNanchor621"></a><a href="#Footnote621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> show that the titanium-treated
steel has a far cleaner fracture and far more homogeneous
structure than steels not so treated; on the other hand, the
micro-photographs of Treuheit<a id="FNanchor622"></a><a href="#Footnote622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> show practically no improvement
in structure for the titanium steel. The exhaustive
tests of the first two authors, again, and the experiments of
numerous railways in the use of titanium steel rails,<a id="FNanchor623"></a><a href="#Footnote623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> demonstrate
clearly that the treatment results in improvement in
strength and durability of the product; but the work of
Otto<a id="FNanchor624"></a><a href="#Footnote624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> proves equally clearly that his products did not differ
markedly, whether titanium-treated or not, and he is of opinion
that the rail tests were not sufficiently prolonged or searching
to be considered conclusive. It is nevertheless to be considered
certain that the use of titanium does cause a marked
improvement in the quality of the steels obtained, and especially
in the durability of rails. The negative results obtained by
some authors may be explained, firstly, on the ground that
no tests are conclusive unless carried out with steel from the
one bath, one half of which has been treated with titanium,
and the other half not so treated; secondly, that the ferro-titanium
must be incorporated with the metal, and must not
be suffered to be taken up by the slag, and so lost; and thirdly,
that the bath must be allowed to remain for some minutes
after treatment, in order that the reaction may be complete,
and the titanium-bearing slag allowed to rise to the surface.
When these conditions are carefully observed, experiment
shows that marked improvement in the quality of the steels
produced is effected.</p>

<p>As to the actual nature of the effect produced, it is generally
believed that titanium acts merely as a cleansing agent, freeing
the metal from occluded or combined gases, and removing
blow-holes, so producing a denser and more homogeneous
structure, with consequent improvement in properties. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
added titanium is usually found entirely in the slag, so that
it appears certain that it does not alloy, but merely purifies.
It certainly acts as a powerful and rapid deoxidiser, removing
the last traces of the gas which have escaped the action of
the manganese, silicon, etc., with which steels are now generally
treated. Many authorities, on the ground of analyses,
and of the known affinity of titanium for nitrogen, believe
that it very largely reduces the nitrogen-content,<a id="FNanchor625"></a><a href="#Footnote625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> which is so
harmful; this, however, is still an open question.<a id="FNanchor626"></a><a href="#Footnote626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> It is stated
that if excess of titanium is used, so that small quantities&mdash;0·05-0·20
per cent.&mdash;remain in the finished steel, the toughness
and durability are further increased;<a id="FNanchor627"></a><a href="#Footnote627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> but as a rule,
manufacturers prefer to work with smaller quantities, so that
no free titanium remains in the product.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">The preparation of alloys of titanium with almost all the
commoner metals is protected by patent, but few of these are
of technical importance. Small quantities of titanium are
said to improve very considerably the properties of copper and
its alloys, the brasses, bronzes, etc., especially in castings.
The addition is usually made in the form of an appropriate
titanium alloy, prepared by reduction of the mixed oxides with

recalls the method of formation of cementation steels. He has
found that if a metal be loosely covered with its alloy with
titanium, in a finely powdered condition, and the whole heated,
the titanium diffuses into the metal, to a depth and concentration
which vary with the temperature and the time of heating.
He suggests that in this way a metallic body may be toughened<span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span>

<h4 class="inline"><b>Application to Arc-lamp Electrodes.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;During the last fifteen
years, innumerable efforts have been made to adapt titanium
and its compounds to the manufacture of arc-lamp electrodes,
or pencils.<a id="FNanchor631"></a><a href="#Footnote631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> The spark-spectrum of titanium is very rich
in lines, and in respect of light efficiency, the element is very
suitable for the purpose; the experimental difficulties, however,
have been very great, and though electrodes containing titanium
compounds have been on the market for some years, the
problem cannot be said to have been satisfactorily solved.
The best pencils contain titanium carbide, but successful
attempts have been made to use the oxide. As early as 1904,
Weedon<a id="FNanchor632"></a><a href="#Footnote632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> proposed an electrode prepared by heating 7 parts
(1 mol.) of the dioxide with 1 part of carbon to 1500°-2000°C.;
the ‘sub-oxide’ produced was powdered, worked up into a
paste with a suitable binding material, and forced through
a nozzle. The sticks so obtained, after drying and baking
in the usual manner, were said to give satisfactory results,
but consumption is very rapid, and troublesome deposits
of the dioxide are formed at the end of the electrode. The
dioxide, which alone is a very bad conductor, enters directly
into the composition of the so-called ‘magnetite’ pencils,
which are best made<a id="FNanchor633"></a><a href="#Footnote633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> by fusing together magnetite, rutile,
and chromite, in suitable proportions, with a little potassium
fluoride, powdering the brittle mass, and using this to form a
paste from which the pencils may be obtained as usual. These
electrodes are said to give a very efficient and fairly steady arc.
They have the disadvantage that tiny glowing particles are
thrown off, which soon render the globes opaque; the addition
of sulphur<a id="FNanchor634"></a><a href="#Footnote634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> to the powder during manufacture is said greatly to
diminish this inconvenience. Pencils made in a similar manner
from powdered ferro-titanium<a id="FNanchor635"></a><a href="#Footnote635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> do not appear to have come
into use.</p>

short, and the arc soon becomes flickering and unsteady. A

on the anode, and once the current has been interrupted, this
deposit renders it very difficult to strike the arc again. These
disadvantages are largely overcome by a series of improvements
recently patented in Germany by the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts
Gesellschaft of Berlin. Addition of small quantities&mdash;4·5 per
cent.&mdash;of chromium carbide increases the length of
life;<a id="FNanchor637"></a><a href="#Footnote637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> the unsteadiness
and flickering are greatly diminished by incorporation
of powdered coke, cryolite and fluorspar,<a id="FNanchor638"></a><a href="#Footnote638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> or better, of the
titanofluoride of calcium or cerium,<a id="FNanchor639"></a><a href="#Footnote639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
whilst the addition of finely
divided sulphur (or selenium or tellurium)<a id="FNanchor640"></a><a href="#Footnote640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> greatly reduces
the disadvantage due to the throwing off of incandescent
particles. The British Thomson-Houston Company patents
a similar electrode,<a id="FNanchor641"></a><a href="#Footnote641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> in which a carbon-mixture is used instead
of coke, and the electrode is manufactured with a carbon shell.
For this purpose, the paste prepared from the powdered mixture
may be filled into a hollow carbon rod, or the lightly baked
pencil may be coated with pitch and heated to a high temperature.
The use of a mixture of cerium fluoride and tungstate, with
carbon and cryolite, is also said to prevent flickering.<a id="FNanchor642"></a><a href="#Footnote642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>In arc lamps in which pencils containing titanium compounds
are used, the anode is generally made of copper, and
is placed below the cathode, the reverse being the case where
carbon electrodes are employed. The copper is inactive, and
contributes nothing to the light; if the anode be of suitable
dimensions, it wears away very slowly, whereas the cathode,
containing the titanium compound, is rapidly consumed. In
lamps in which carbon electrodes are used, the light is emitted
chiefly from the extremities of the electrodes, the path of the
arc being comparatively non-luminous; the light has the
familiar reddish-yellow colour characteristic of the earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span>
forms of arc lamps. Where titanium pencils are employed,
however, the light is emitted almost entirely from the arc
itself, the electrodes contributing very little, and is of a pure
white colour, very different from that of the carbon lamp.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to employ titanium in the
manufacture of metal filaments for glow lamps. The metal
would be very suitable for this purpose, by reason of its high
melting-point and low conductivity, but the difficulty of
obtaining it in the pure state, and the remarkable susceptibility
of the filament to traces of impurity, have so far proved insuperable.
For the sake of illustration, a proposal put forward
in 1908 may be briefly referred to.<a id="FNanchor643"></a><a href="#Footnote643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Pure titanium dioxide
is heated in a stream of ammonia; the nitride obtained is
decomposed at 1200° <i>in vacuo</i>, and after cooling, the metal
is powdered and made into a paste with a solution of albumen
in ammonia. The threads obtained from this in the usual
manner are heated to 1200° in an electric furnace; the carbon
deposited from the albumen forms the cyanide by reaction with
the trace of nitride which has escaped decomposition, or
which has been formed by further action of ammonia. The
cyanide is volatile, and can be removed at high temperatures
<i>in vacuo</i>, leaving a sintered filament of the metal. So susceptible
is the filament to impurity, that the trace of carbon
deposited from the vapour of the oil of the pump which diffuses
into the vacuum is sufficient to render it so fragile as to be
useless.<a id="FNanchor644"></a><a href="#Footnote644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

treatment of prepared animal skins by immersion in a bath
of a titanium salt. Subsequent boiling or steaming causes
hydrolysis, with precipitation in the skin of hydrated titanium

in the dye-bath. Whilst this treatment has been found satisfactory
with some classes of leather goods,<a id="FNanchor647"></a><a href="#Footnote647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> more delicate kinds
are liable to be injured by the mineral acid set free, and numerous

The same investigator<a id="FNanchor649"></a><a href="#Footnote649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> has discovered that excellent results
can be obtained in the cold by the addition of various ‘Hülfsalze,’
which are chiefly acetates or formates of the alkaline
earth metals, chromium, or aluminium, or basic salts of the

that the hydrated oxide or a basic compound is formed on

<p>The titanium salts specified in these patents are salts of
the element in the tetravalent condition, prepared from rutile
by the action of strong mineral acids. As early as 1902, the
technical preparation of salts of trivalent titanium for reducing
purposes was patented by Spence and Spence, of Manchester.<a id="FNanchor650"></a><a href="#Footnote650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
The process is an electrolytic one, and is effected in a cell divided
into two compartments by a porous partition, one electrode
being introduced into each compartment; an electromotive
force of 3-4 volts is required. A 20-25 per cent. titanium
tetrachloride solution is introduced into the cathode compartment,
and dilute hydrochloric acid into the anode compartment;
on electrolysing, chlorine is evolved at the anode, and may be
utilised as usual in the preparation of bleaching powder, etc.,
whilst the tetrachloride in the cathode compartment is reduced
to trichloride. The solution is then concentrated at 65°-70°C.
under reduced pressure, and the crystalline trichloride separated.
In the preparation of the corresponding sulphate, sodium
sulphate must be present in the cathode compartment, and a
double salt is obtained; the process is carried out in lead-lined
cells, in presence of excess of sulphuric acid. The preparation
of the sesquioxide, Ti₂O₃, free from compounds of aluminium<span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span>
and iron, was also suggested by Dreher<a id="FNanchor651"></a><a href="#Footnote651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> by reduction of the
acid solution of the impure or mixed salts with zinc or sodium
amalgam, and approximate neutralisation; the sesquioxide
differs from the dioxide in that it separates while the solution
is still somewhat acid, which the hydrated oxides of iron and
aluminium will not do. Dreher suggested that the strong
reducing properties of the sesquioxide and its salts should
make these valuable for bleaching, colour-printing, and similar
purposes.</p>

<p>More recently<a id="FNanchor652"></a><a href="#Footnote652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> the reduction of titanium salts by means
of aluminium powder has been suggested; in the case of the
sulphate, the aluminium salt formed may be partly eliminated
as alum, in the ordinary way, if desired, but it is claimed
that its effect is beneficial rather than harmful. The preparation
of organic double basic salts of trivalent titanium,<a id="FNanchor653"></a><a href="#Footnote653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> which
hydrolyse very readily, suggested the use of such compounds
as mordants and for reducing purposes. These salts may be
prepared fairly easily<a id="FNanchor654"></a><a href="#Footnote654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> by adding concentrated solutions of
the appropriate potassium, sodium, or ammonium salts in
excess to concentrated solutions of the trichloride, in absence
of air. The double salts separate, and are washed and dried;
in this condition they are fairly stable, but the solutions
hydrolyse at once on merely warming, with separation of the
hydrated sesquioxide. On this account, and also because
of the strong reducing action, these compounds are likely to
prove valuable as mordants, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>Titanium compounds have frequently been suggested for
the preparation of colouring-matters; the ferrocyanide has a
fine green colour, and is used to some extent in place of arsenical
pigments for the preparation of coloured wall-papers, whilst
the dioxide is of some value for tinting artificial teeth, porcelain
tiles, etc. Yellow and reddish-yellow pigments are
produced from rutile and ilmenite by various methods. A
fine covering paint is said to be obtained by a
process<a id="FNanchor655"></a><a href="#Footnote655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span>
which ilmenite is powdered and roasted to 500°C.; the cooled
product is crushed with water, and after one or two washings
to remove soluble compounds, yields a very finely divided
orange-yellow suspension, the precise shade of which varies
with the duration and temperature of the roasting. The
product is at once thrown down from the suspension, by
addition of a small quantity of a salt solution, and so can
easily be obtained in the solid state. In another process,<a id="FNanchor656"></a><a href="#Footnote656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
the pulverised ilmenite is warmed with concentrated sulphuric
acid, in which it dissolves with great development of heat;
the excess of acid is removed by evaporation and the mass
calcined to decompose the sulphates. It is stated that different
shades may be obtained by carrying out the last operation
in an atmosphere of sulphur dioxide or other gas.</p>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Owing to the high

preparation of enamels and opaque glasses, innumerable
suggestions have been made for the employment of the oxides
of titanium and zirconium in this direction.<a id="FNanchor658"></a><a href="#Footnote658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>
A critical examination
of the question has been made by Grünwald;<a id="FNanchor659"></a><a href="#Footnote659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> he finds
that the opacity consequent on addition of these compounds
increases with the amount of clay used, within limits, and
concludes that the effect is due to displacement of alumina
by the oxides, with formation of silicates of titanium and zirconium,
which dissolve in the melt. He states that the results
obtained from the use of these oxides are not comparable
with those given when stannic oxide is employed, and that
therefore the former oxides are of little use for this purpose.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Much work has been carried out during the last few years

of nitrogen.</p>

<p>The metal combines very vigorously with the gas at about
800°C. (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page224">p. 224</a>), forming the nitride. If the gas, or air,
be passed over a heated mixture of the dioxide with powdered

<h4 class="inline"><b>Estimation of the Element.</b></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Owing to the difficulties of the
separation from the acidic oxides, silica, zirconia, and the pentoxides
of columbium and tantalum, and from the basic oxides,
alumina and the oxides of iron and tin, the estimation of
titanium in a mineral or a steel is usually a difficult and tedious
process. Gravimetric as well as volumetric methods are employed.
In the former, the element is isolated and weighed in
the form of the dioxide; in the latter, standard solutions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page339">[339]</span>
suitable oxidising agents are employed, advantage being
taken of the ease with which the element can be transformed
from the trivalent to the tetravalent condition.</p>

<p>The mineral or steel in which the element is to be estimated
is usually fused with sodium hydrogen sulphate, which forms
the sulphate. If thorium, uranium or rare earths are present,
treatment in the cold with hydrofluoric acid is often more
suitable; the acidic oxides are taken into solution, leaving
the more positive elements in the form of the insoluble fluorides.
Trautmann finds that steels or ferro-titaniums of high silicon
content are attacked only very slightly by fused sodium bisulphate;
he recommends<a id="FNanchor667"></a><a href="#Footnote667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> ignition to the oxides, evaporation with
hydrofluoric acid to remove silicon as the volatile tetrafluoride,
and fusion of the residue with bisulphate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote667"><a href="#FNanchor667"><span class="label">[667]</span></a> <i>Zeitsch. angew. Chem.</i> 1911, <b>24</b>, 877.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The bisulphate melt, after cooling, is leached with water, and
the whole boiled under a reflux condenser for several hours;
this treatment should throw down the oxides of titanium,
columbium and tantalum, leaving zirconium and aluminium
in the form of the sulphates in the acid solution; the addition
of ammonia may be necessary to effect complete hydrolysis.
The acidic oxides may also be precipitated if the solution be
diluted and treated with excess of acetic acid before boiling.
In both cases, a considerable quantity of iron is thrown
down. The precipitated oxides are dissolved in the cold
by dilute sulphuric acid to which hydrogen peroxide has been
added.</p>

<p>For volumetric estimation, separation from iron is not
generally necessary. If gravimetric methods are to be employed,
separation may be effected in several ways. Titanium
dioxide may be precipitated in a fairly pure condition by
reducing the solution with sulphur dioxide, and boiling until
the titanium sulphate has been completely hydrolysed. According
to Barneby and Isham,<a id="FNanchor668"></a><a href="#Footnote668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> this method gives low results;
these authors prefer to remove iron completely from the
solution, and then effect complete hydrolysis by addition of
ammonium acetate and acetic acid to the boiling solution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
For this purpose, they dissolve the mixed oxides in hydrochloric
acid, and remove ferric chloride by ether extraction.
Bornemann and Schirmeister<a id="FNanchor669"></a><a href="#Footnote669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> precipitate titanium dioxide
completely by means of ammonia, holding iron in solution
as ferrocyanide; for this purpose, iron is completely reduced
to the ferrous state by means of sodium hydrogen sulphite,
and solutions of potassium cyanide and ammonia are added
together to the warm liquid, which is afterwards heated nearly
to the boiling-point to effect the precipitation.</p>

<p>Iron may also be removed by the ordinary methods, if
some reagent be previously added to hold titanium in solution.
For this purpose, tartaric acid and its salts are commonly used;
none of the ordinary precipitants will throw down the element
if this reagent be present. After addition of ammonium
tartrate, iron is removed by means of ammonium sulphide.
After filtering, tartaric acid may be removed by means of
potassium permanganate, the manganese dioxide formed being
reduced with sulphur dioxide. According to Thornton,<a id="FNanchor670"></a><a href="#Footnote670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
evaporation with a mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids is
a more convenient method of destroying the organic acid;
titanium dioxide is then thrown down by diluting and boiling
in the usual way.</p>

<p>Bourion<a id="FNanchor671"></a><a href="#Footnote671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> describes a method of separating the oxides by
the action of a mixture of hydrogen chloride and sulphur monochloride
at a suitable temperature. The ferric chloride which
is formed sublimes, leaving titanium dioxide unattacked.</p>

<p>For volumetric estimation of small quantities of titanium
in solution, colorimetric methods are generally employed.
Addition of hydrogen peroxide to such a solution gives an intense
reddish-yellow colouration, which is compared with the colourations
obtained with solutions containing known quantities of
the element. Wells<a id="FNanchor672"></a><a href="#Footnote672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> finds that under suitable conditions, an
accuracy of about 2 per cent. is to be expected with this method.
Lehner and Crawford<a id="FNanchor673"></a><a href="#Footnote673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> find that in concentrated sulphuric
acid solution, thymol gives a red colouration which is at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page341">[341]</span>
twenty-five times as intense as the colour given by hydrogen
peroxide, and they accordingly propose thymol as a suitable
reagent for the colorimetric estimation. Fenton<a id="FNanchor674"></a><a href="#Footnote674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> has shown
that a very intense colouration is obtained when a solution of
a titanium salt is treated with dihydroxymaleic acid; this
reaction has been shown by Mellor<a id="FNanchor675"></a><a href="#Footnote675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> to be well adapted for the
colorimetric estimation and for the estimation of titanium
and vanadium together in a solution.</p>

<p>The volumetric methods for the estimation of larger quantities
require complete reduction to the trivalent condition.
This is best effected by means of zinc and hydrochloric acid,
or, where potassium permanganate is to be used, by zinc and
sulphuric acid. Precautions must be taken to ensure that reduction
is complete; an apparatus suitable for rapid estimations
has recently been described by Shimer and Shimer.<a id="FNanchor676"></a><a href="#Footnote676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Where
potassium permanganate is employed (Pisani’s method), the
iron must be estimated separately by means of a standard
solution of titanium trichloride. Knecht and Hibbert<a id="FNanchor677"></a><a href="#Footnote677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> titrate
directly, after reduction, with a standard solution of a ferric
salt, using potassium thiocyanate as indicator; here no
correction has to be applied for iron originally present in
the solution. The same advantage attaches also to the
method of titration by means of methylene blue,<a id="FNanchor678"></a><a href="#Footnote678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> a dye
reduced to the colourless leuco-base by salts of trivalent
titanium, but not affected by ferrous salts.</p>

<h2>Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Inconsistent and unusual spelling and hyphenation (including those of proper
and geographical names) have been retained, except as mentioned below.</p>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used and their settings, not all elements may display as intended.</p>

<p>Hyperlinks have been provided for explicit internal references, except
where the intended target is unclear or non-existent, or where the reference may refer to multiple targets.</p>

<p>Texts in <span class="illotext tn">a dotted box</span> have been transcribed from the illustration for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>Lists of elements were printed both with and without separating commas (for example, R´´ =
Ca, Fe´´, Be and R´ = NH₄,K,Rb,Cs); these have not been standardised.</p>

<p>Pages 34, weighing 200 lb.: later (page 41) referred to as weighing 300 lb.</p>

<p>Some tables appear to use nm, others Å; this has not been standardised.</p>

<p>Page 181, table: 5923·35 may be an error; it is out of sequence.</p>

<p>Page 200, table: 379·5 may be an error; it is out of sequence.</p>

<p>Page 236, (NH₄)₂O₂,TiO₃,H₂O₂: as printed in the source document; the final O₂ is probably an error.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Changes:</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to under the paragraph in which they are referenced; illustrations have
been moved out of text paragraphs.</p>

<p>Some obvious minor typographical and punctuation errors have been corrected silently.</p>

<p>Moh’s scale has been changed to Mohs’ scale, Guèrin and Guérin to Guérin.
Where there was a space between the number and the percent sign,  or between the degree sign and the C,
this has been deleted for the sake of consistency.</p>

<p>Page vii: Blomstandine changed to Blomstrandine.</p>

<p>Page 20, Monazite: Yttr = 1 4; changed to Yttr = 1-4;</p>

<p>Page 26: Osterby changed to Österby.</p>

<p>Page 46: Struverite changed to Strüverite as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Page 87: Kraus and Heitinger changed to Kraus and Reitinger.</p>

<p>Page 155: Footnote anchor [194] was missing in the source document, and has been inserted at the end of the paragraph.</p>
